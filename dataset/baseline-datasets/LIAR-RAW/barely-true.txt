A month later , Obama say that the use of such weapon be a “ red line ” and that cross it would entail “ enormous consequence ” .
***** On the last Saturday of August 2013 , Labor Day weekend , the United States be once again about to go to war in the Middle East .  This brazen assault have clearly cross the “ red line ” that President Barack Obama have enunciate a year earlier—that if Assad use chemical weapon , it would warrant U .  ” Instead of order strike immediately , the president want to pump the brake and first go to Congress to ask for it authorization .  Even the president ’ s sympathizer call the handling of the red line statement and it cross a “ debacle , ” an “ amateurish improvisation ” or the administration ’ s “ bad blunder .

Alternately describe a one of the former president ’ s great success or a one of his bad failure , what remain of Obama ’ s red line deal be now under attack .  The Ghouta attack appear to constitute a direct challenge to Obama , who have state a year earlier that “ a red line for u be we start see a whole bunch of chemical weapon move around or be utilize .  ” 6 Indeed , if Obama restrict himself to a symbolic slap or another raft of sanction , both enemy and ally would be likely to interpret this a a sign of weakness and , rightly or wrongly , a a failure to follow through on his red line threat .  Last but not least , Obama be clearly uncomfortable with the idea that a nerve gas attack on civilian neighborhood should go unpunished .  National Intelligence Council would later conclude that “ unenforced red line in Syria ” have damage U .
***** In August 2012 , President Barack Obama say the red line for U .  He say , “ We have communicate in no uncertain term with every player in the region that that 's a red line for u and that there would be enormous consequence if we start see movement on the chemical weapon front or the use of chemical weapon .

So he be send into Syria for what be really a mission impossible , to try to convince the Syrians to let him conduct a real investigation , to go to place , to talk to victim .

***** On August 20 , 2012 , then-President Barack Obama tell a group of reporter the use of chemical weapon by Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime in Syria would cross his “ red line .  Assad ’ s continue use of chemical weapon offer even more evidence of how badly the Obama administration misjudge and mishandle the “ red line ” moment .  “ We enforce the red line diplomatically , not militarily , and far more effectively than if we have use force , ” Antony Blinken , a top Obama State Department and White House official , tell me .

One year earlier , President Barack Obama have describe Assad ’ s potential use of chemical weapon a a red line that would have enormous consequence and change my calculus on American military intervention in Syria ’ s civil war .

For now Obamas concern seem to be to restore his credibility on that red line and establish a deterrence against further chemical weapon attack .  I mean he keep on test the limit of how far he can go .  Schools , hospital , park , private business , and entire public infrastructure be completely go .  government appear to have decide that , whatever happen in Homs , it didn ’ t cross the chemical “ red line ” that the President on down have pledge would trigger outside intervention into the civil war .
***** For Barack Obama , one of those phrase would be “ red line .  “ We have be very clear to the Assad regime , ” he say , “ that a red line for u be we start see a whole bunch of chemical weapon move around or be utilize .  Weeks and month go by with no sign of chemical attack in Syria .  The question then become what we be go to do about it .  “ This be go to be different—in both scope and scale—in term of what we be provide to the opposition .

But Obama play down the importance of his red line comment a year ago by suggest Congress and the world already have make similar pronouncement about military intervention .

Obamas revisitation of the red line statement come during a joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister in Stockholm , after Obama be ask whether a strike [ be ] need in order to preserve your credibility for when you set these sort of red line ? .  Obama respond that he wasnt the one who set a red line , that it be a line set by the international community .  First of all , I didn ’ t set a red line ; the world set a red line .  Twice , Obama refer to the use of chemical weapon a a red line for u mean the United States .  Obama cite the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Syria Accountability Act both of which prohibit the use of chemical weapon , which one could certainly argue be red line but neither one authorize a unilateral military response .  Obama be correct to argue that the international community have long draw a red line condemn the use of chemical weapon , but his point blur the fact that his red line comment in August 2012 be make in the context of what it might take for the U .  military involvement to Assad use chemical weapon be Obamas red line .

BloombergBloomberg via Getty Images On Monday , the Supreme Court rule in a 5-4 decision that the government can not require certain employer to provide insurance coverage for birth control if they conflict with the employer religious belief .  Heres what woman need to know .  If you work at certain type of for-profit company , they no longer have to cover the cost of any contraception that they say violates their religious belief The Affordable Care Act ( a .  Obamacare ) require most health insurance plan to cover birth control without cost-sharing .  The exemption seek by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga woulddeny legion of woman who do not hold their employer belief access to contraceptive coverage , Ginsburg write .  While some woman be able to choose their place of employment take health care into consideration , because of geography and economic restriction , thats not possible for all woman .  The fallout from today rule could be that some woman who work company that refuse to cover the IUD may be discourage from use this effective birth control method by additional cost they may incur or the complication of find supplemental insurance .  Womens right group say restrict insurance coverage for some type of contraception , or make coverage more difficult to obtain , undermines access to birth control in general and point to study that have show that offer great access to contraceptionrather than restrict itleads to fewer unintended pregnancy and thus reduce the number of abortion by 75 percent annually .
***** Shots - Health News The Supreme Court say closely hold corporation may be exempt from the health law 's contraceptive mandate .  In a 5-4 decision Monday , the Supreme Court allow a key exemption to the health law 's contraception coverage requirement when it rule that closely hold for-profit business could assert a religious objection to the Obama administration 's regulation .  The court 's majority say that the for-profit company that file suit — Hobby Lobby Stores , a nationwide chain of 500 art and craft store , and Conestoga Wood Specialties , a maker of custom cabinet — do n't have to offer female employee all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive a part of a package of preventive service that must be cover without copays or deductible under the law .  What do the health law say about contraception coverage ? .  As part of the law 's coverage of preventive health service , health insurance plan be require to cover all FDA-approved contraception method for woman without any cost-sharing , such a deductible or copayments .  These large employer that do n't offer any coverage face a fine of $ 2,000 for most employee .  Writing for the majority , Justice Samuel Alito state that Hobby Lobby would have face fine of $ 475 million a year and Conestoga $ 33 million for exclude some form of birth control from their health plan .
***** They also believe that support and finance their company health care plan in a way that provide their employee with the mean to destroy a fertilized egg make them complicit in a sinful and immoral act .  Their objection be to four of 18 method require to be provide to female employee under the Affordable Care Act ’ s contraception mandate .  Are those employer now entitle to eliminate birth control in every form from their company health care plan ? .  The day after the Supreme Court ’ s Hobby Lobby decision , the court vacate a decision by an appeal court that have rule against a Michigan company that object to provide any contraceptive under it employee health plan .  Such an accommodation would involve either the government or an insurance provider pay for religiously-objectionable contraceptive service .  Under the ACA ’ s contraception mandate , the owner of Hobby Lobby be force into a dilemma .  either fund the objectionable contraception method and violate their religious belief or pay up to $ 475 million in penalty and remain faithful to their belief .  ” In it Hobby Lobby ruling , the high court find that the government have fail to demonstrate that the ACA ’ s contraception mandate be the least restrictive mean ( mean least burdensome to religious practice ) of achieve it goal of provide cost-free access to female employee to the full range of contraceptive method .
***** In 2012 , the US Department of Health and Human Services issue the contraception mandate , which require that employer-provided health insurance plan offer their beneficiary certain contraceptive method free of charge .  Many of the ACA ’ s reform be direct towards healthcare insurer and mandate which service they be require to cover .  The ACA include a provision require employer-sponsored health insurance plan to cover certain preventative health service at no cost to the individual .  , authority to determine which preventive service health insurance plan must cover .  On 15 February 2012 , the HHS , the US Department of Labor , and the US Department of Treasury finalize regulation that detail which preventative health service insurer have to cover .  If a corporation instead choose not to offer any healthcare plan to employee , the corporation be charge a 2,000 dollar fine each year for each employee it fail to insure .  According to the Greens , the contraceptive mandate interfere with their corporation ’ s right to exercise their religious belief by force their employer-provided health plan to cover four FDA-approved contraceptive method that they consider to induce abortion .  The ACA , Alito argue , violate Hobby Lobby ’ s right under RFRA by compel Hobby Lobby to provide certain contraception method that burden the corporation ’ s religious belief , but fail to do so in the least restrictive manner .  According to Alito , the government could have propose other mean of guarantee woman access to the four debate method of contraception without require employer to provide them through employee health plan .

The company ’ s owner say they object to four out of the 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved form of contraception — the four that prevent implantation of the embryo .  Two be form of “ emergency contraception , ” sometimes call the “ morning-after pill , ” and two be intra-uterine device , or IUDs .  Contrary to Clinton ’ s claim , Hobby Lobby ’ s website say the company do in fact support the other 16 form of contraception .  So Clinton go too far when she say the salesclerk “ be not go to get ” contraception through the company ’ s health care plan .  And the fact that the company pay for 16 type undercut Clinton ’ s claim that Hobby Lobby “ doesn ’ t think she should be use contraception .  ” Where Clinton ’ s claim include a grain of truth be that the salesclerk will not have an unfettered choice in what form of contraception she get .  An IUD might be a good alternative , but it would not be available to her under Hobby Lobby ’ s health care plan .  “ To the extent she be talk about Hobby Lobby a an employer specifically , I think Clinton overstate her case , ” say I .  He add , “ It may be true for a subset of employee , and to the extent she be also refer to other potential employer who might ban all contraceptive , I think she be on firm ground .  ” Our rule Clinton say that “ a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception … be not go to get that service through her employer ’ s health care plan because her employer doesn ’ t think she should be use contraception .  Hobby Lobby doesn ’ t shun contraception entirely for it employee ; it pay for access to 16 out of the FDA ’ s 20 approve method .  Where Clinton have a partial point be that an employee would be bar from have the company pay for four other type , even if one of those may be the best medical option for the employee ’ s need .  It would deny legion of woman who do not hold their employer ’ beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure .

This may seem shockingly undemocratic , but it 's completely possible give how the convention work .  The delegate get to set their own rule , and no high body can overrule them .  So they 're perfectly free to change those rule at the last minute — even if those change be obviously mean to alter the outcome of the race .

Though bound to vote for Trump on the first ballot , these people could in fact hope to deny him the nomination .

Following several incremental breach of the 2015 nuclear deal , Tehran have announce that it will no longer abide by all the accord ’ s restriction .  While there be sign of de-escalation , Tehran and Washington could still be head for a confrontation that spell the nuclear deal ’ s end and spark a broad regional conflict .  and Iran on the nuclear and military front , involve sanction relief , Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal and regional de-escalation .  Executive Summary The Iran nuclear deal , know a the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) , enter it fifth year of implementation under siege from all side .  and Iran mount in the aftermath of the Trump administration ’ s decision to kill Major General Qassem Soleimani , head of Iran ’ s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force .

It likely will require third-party mediation to reach an understanding that give Tehran an economic reprieve and halt or reverse it nuclear measure but also avoid further escalation , by either the U .  escalate on the nuclear and regional front while leave open the possibility of a diplomatic off-ramp .

***** Heavy Water Loophole in the Iran Deal by David Albright and Andrea Stricker December 21 , 2016 Download PDF Although President-elect Donald Trump ’ s position on the Iran nuclear deal remain unclear , he and his ally in the Congress be expect to at least good enforce and strengthen the Iran deal .  They should start by focus on the deal ’ s heavy water loophole , whereby Iran can store offshore in Oman heavy water it own and control in excess of the nuclear deal ’ s limit , await it eventual sale .  To date , if the stock in Iran and Oman be count together ( a reasonable view since Iran own and control both stock ) , Iran have far exceed the nuclear deal ’ s state limit of maintain a stock of only 130 metric ton of heavy water .  Despite such generous treatment , Iran have even so twice violate the narrow limit of 130 metric ton of heavy water it can hold inside Iran since the deal start in January 2016 .  Iran should no longer be facilitate in it overproduction of nuclear-related heavy water .  Oman would do the world a favor by halt it willingness to accept Iranian heavy water and send any back to Iran for downblending .  The return of the heavy water and it blend down would dramatically signal to Iran that violation of the Iran deal be no longer go to be tolerate , or bad , facilitate .  purchase of Iranian heavy water .  Heavy Water Limits Violated and then Facilitated Heavy water be control because of it link to Iran ’ s plutonium pathway to nuclear weapon .  Iran ’ s last violation of the 130 metric ton cap of the stock in Iran occur in November , despite Iran receive a warning from the international inspector charge with monitor the nuclear deal .  Sound enforcement of the Iran deal should have mandate that Iran blend down any excess heavy water to normal water or stop produce more .  Based on an analysis of the DOE ’ s purchase price of the heavy water and Iran ’ s heavy water plant , Iran sell it heavy water to the United States at below it cost to produce the heavy water and the market price internationally .  purchase of Iran ’ s heavy water unfairly help Iran enter the international market and disrupt the exist commercial market .  company so that they can buy heavy water directly from Iran .  purchase of heavy water and subsequent action turn the Obama administration into a promoter and legitimizer of Iran ’ s heavy water sale .  The arrangement have only encourage Iran to overproduce heavy water for sale and seek legitimacy a a nuclear supplier .  Lastly , instead of further disrupt the North American market and subsidize Iran , the United States should work to minimize the damage of it heavy water purchase .

***** WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States will buy heavy water from Iran ’ s nuclear program and expect it to be deliver within week , U .  Iran 's top nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi leave a hotel after meet senior official from the United States , Russia , China , Britain , Germany and France in Vienna , Austria , October 19 , 2015 .  Department of Energy , or DOE , will buy 32 metric tonne of heavy water from Iran worth $ 8 .  Heavy water be a component of make nuclear weapon and nuclear energy , that be not radioactive .  Under last year ’ s landmark nuclear deal between Iran , the United States and five other world power , Tehran be responsible for reduce it stock of heavy water , which it can sell , dilute or dispose of , under condition .  Iran be permit to keep up to 130 tonne of heavy water at present and up to 90 tonne once it redesign and rebuild Arak nuclear research reactor be commission .  Iran ’ s compliance with the nuclear deal mean that the heavy water be already remove from Iran , ensure that it would not be use to support the development of a nuclear weapon , State Department spokesman John Kirby say .

***** At the same time , I be convince that we should only relieve pressure on Iran in exchange for verifiable concession that will fundamentally dismantle Iran 's nuclear program -- not by a month or two , but by a year or more -- and that it be do in such a way that alarm bell will sound from Vienna to Washington , should Iran restart it program anytime in the next 20 to 30 year .  Any deal the administration reach with Iran must be verifiable , effective , and prevent Iran from ever develop even one nuclear weapon .  As Ali Akbar Salehi , the head of Iran 's nuclear agency , say last week on Iranian state television about the agreement , `` The iceberg of sanction be melt while our centrifuge be also still work .  At the end of the day , any final deal must require Iran to dismantle large portion of it nuclear infrastructure .  It must eliminate the vast majority of Iran 's 20,000 centrifuge , close the Fordow facility , and stop the heavy water reactor at Arak from ever come online .  And it must address Iran 's weaponization activity at Parchin and possibly elsewhere , something not directly deal with by the Joint Plan of Action .  At the end of the day , Iran can no longer be a nuclear- weapons-threshold state .  But , somehow , because Congress want to ensure that we end up with a proper end state -- be a lot of unfortunate thing that have be say .  And I , too , a the chairman mention , support very much the administration 's effort to ensure that Iran do not have nuclear weapon and we be able to resolve this in a peaceful manner .  And I think it avoid the topic of you , candidly , clearly lay out to u what the end state be that you be try to negotiate .  And I hope today you will clearly -- I just get your testimony ; I have not see it -- just come in 5 minute ago -- I hope that you will clearly lay out what the end state be , because I think that be what so many of u be concern about , that this interim deal become the permanent deal .  We believe that it have set out a framework for a comprehensive agreement to ensure that Iran do not obtain a nuclear weapon .

Heavy water , or deuterium oxide , be a form of water that contain a larger-than-normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium .  The water be call `` heavy , `` because the deuterium increase the chemical 's mass .  It also give the chemical different property than regular water that make it more useful for nuclear research and weapon production .  The United States have not be able to produce heavy water since 1996 and the Department of Energy 's current supply be it only source for weapon program .  Since then , DOE have be able to obtain some heavy water from the Department of Defense to be use for weapon activity only , along with a 32-metric-ton purchase from Iran that can not be use for any weapon relate activity at all due to nonproliferation agreement .

The United States and like-minded ally have relentlessly strive to coerce and compel Tehran to curb it nuclear activity .  Its uranium enrichment program and effort to obtain full nuclear fuel-cycle capability have be of particular concern .  Attaining such capability would mean that Iran could fuel both nuclear power plant and atomic bomb .  But negotiation , punish economic and political sanction , covert sabotage , and military threat have at best delayed Irans nuclear progress .  One that be often make by Iranian official be that nuclear energy would allow them to consume less petroleum and gas domestically , and instead export it for great economic benefit .

Plutonium Production & Reprocessing Capabilities Iran ’ s primary option to produce plutonium for nuclear weapon be the Arak heavy-water research reactor , which , if complete and operate a plan , could produce enough weapon grade plutonium in it spend fuel for one or two nuclear weapon annually .  Iran will sell on the international market all of it heavy water that be not need for Arak and a support zero-power test reactor , and will keep do so for 15 year .  e JCPOA estimate that Iran will need roughly 130 ton of heavy water until the redesigned Arak reactor begin operation and roughly 90 ton thereafter .  Iran state that it “ plan ” to rely on light-water reactor rather than heavy-water reactor for it power and research reactor ; “ intend ” to ship out spent fuel from all present and future power and research reactor ; and “ do not intend ” to engage in any spent fuel reprocessing or construction of a reprocessing facility .  Uranium Enrichment Capabilities Iran ’ s current enrichment program consists of nearly 18,500 first generation IR-1 centrifuge ( approximately 15,500 instal at Natanz and 3,000 instal at Fordow ) and another 1,000 more-advanced IR-2 centrifuge at Natanz , for a total of about 19,500 centrifuge , with an additional nearly 400 more-advanced centrifuge machine undergo various test and experimentaion at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz .  No uranium enrichment or nuclear material be permit at Fordow for 15 year .  Pre-JCPOA Capabilities Iran claim it be build a heavy-water nuclear reactor at Arak for the purpose of produce medical isotope .  especially if we be see to be de-emphasize a diplomatic solution and the Iranians be see finally to be willing to accept significant constraint on their nuclear program .  the deep-seated rejection of Israel by the current regime in Iran…If the nuclear file be close , and sanction remove , it will bring economic relief ” and “ a renew view from Tehran of the opportunity the world be offering…Then the Iran regime will be able to turn to the public and say , ‘ we should no longer be in the business of fear mongering .  Not to implement new sanction against Iran ; To suspend sanction on gold , precious metal , petrochemical , and Iran ’ s auto industry ; To pause effort to further curtail Iran ’ s oil revenue ( Iran currently produce about 1 million barrel of oil per day ) ; To allow Iran to buy spare part and solicit repair for it airline industry ; To loosen restriction on the trade of food and medicine .
***** Special Presidential Envoy for ClimateBarack Obama44th president of the United StatesNew York ( AFP ) - The United States insist Friday that foreign bank should feel free to do business with Iran after Tehrans compliance with a nuclear deal with world power .  And , a Kerry meet with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for the second time in a week , Washington itself agree to buy 32 tonne of Iranian heavy water .  And , he promise , if bank have question about the remain sanction target Irans missile program and sponsorship of militant group , `` they should just ask .  6 million to buy Iranian heavy water , even a the nuclear deal come under sustain attack from critic in both country .  `` This transaction provide US industry with a critical product , while also enable Iran to sell some of it excess heavy water , `` spokesman John Kirby say .  He say the purchase have come after Iran meet it obligation under the nuclear accord implementation process .  `` This purchase -- part of what appear to be the administration full-court press to sweeten the deal -- will directly subsidize Irans nuclear program , `` he say .
***** Then , in April of 2016 , the United States wire $ 9 million to Iran a part of the deal to move 32 metric ton of heavy water from Iran 's nuclear program .  This be why it be so important to implement tough , smart policy relate to Iran , whether it be to open up relationship and have a discussion about their nuclear program or whether it be to cutoff financing for it support of terrorism , or to fight back against it action , which be clearly provide a destabilizing effect in the Middle East .  The Administration 's decision to complete a payment owe to Iran , a part of a settlement of a 35-year-old dispute , at the same time that the nuclear deal be be implement and Iran be release five wrongfully detained Americans involve many of these issue and raise many of these question .  Our focus today should be on whether this decision advance the national security interest of the United States .  Did the Administration 's decision contribute , at long last , to the release of innocent Americans ? .  With the expiration of the Iran Sanctions Act at the end of the year , it be a legitimate debate whether the Administration need additional authority to prevent Iran from backslide on it nuclear deal and to continue to hold Iranians ' foot to the fire on the development of ballistic missile , support for terrorism , and , importantly , violation of human right .  As the Chairman point out , the fact directly rebut that .  In addition to the consideration that I point out in my statement , I should point out that there be present in the world another rogue State , North Korea , that be cash-starved and that have an active nuclear program .  The Iranians , of course , we know have an active missile program -- ballistic missile program , a program that be not useful for any purpose other than to deliver a nuclear weapon .  So the question then become , do they intend to continue their nuclear program , in part , with the use of this kind of money ? .  Furthermore , the Administration have no problem wire Iran $ 9 million in April a part of a separate agreement to buy Iran 's excess heavy water .  The price that Iran have pay -- and will continue to pay -- for it recalcitrance on the nuclear issue , it support for terrorism and destabilizing action around the region , and it treatment of it own citizen vastly outstrip the compensation that be the subject of this hearing .
***** STR/AFP The 2015 Iran nuclear accord be work , but be at risk from longstanding U .  The 2015 Iran nuclear accord be as successful a it remain fragile .  President Trump ’ s 12 January decision to waive sanction while threaten to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) .  the July 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the five permanent member of the UN Security Council plus Germany ( the P5+1 ) .  unless Congress and Europe agree to unilaterally alter it term , leave the deal in the state of limbo it acquire shortly after his election .  The White House decision constitute little more than a reprieve .  last year , Tehran scrupulously adhere to it nuclear obligation , accord to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , render an undetected dash toward nuclear weapon impossible .  This apparently be only of marginal interest to the Trump administration , which continue to denounce the accord a flaw because some of it nuclear restraint expire between 2026 and 2031 and because it fail to address Iran ’ s broad policy , include it ballistic missile program and support for non-state actor in the region .  Trump take a first major step toward undermine the JCPOA in October , when he refuse to certify the accord on the ground that the sanction it suspend be not proportionate to Iran ’ s nuclear step .  But the administration have both impose other economic penalty and discourage international business with Iran , thereby put Tehran in the uncomfortable position of have to comply with the deal ’ s nuclear restriction while only partially benefit from it economic reward .  For their part , France , Germany , the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have be debate how to signal great concern about Iran ’ s ballistic-missile program and regional activity , consider what to do once some of the nuclear restriction expire and weigh their reaction to passage of the above-mentioned U .  the agreement have put a lid on Iran ’ s nuclear program and open the door to it economic rehabilitation .  restriction impose on Iran ’ s nuclear program expire at some point and which critic say provide Iran with a patient pathway to build nuclear weapon .

***** Should they be stricken with serious ailment , they be at risk of have to forgo proper care or incur catastrophic financial loss .  Americans have come to think of health insurance a a mean of pay all or part of every health expense they incur .  They therefore understand it a necessarily involve broad coverage that include nearly every medical service imaginable , a low deductible ( the amount pay out of pocket before insurance kick in ) , and a low co-pay ( the amount pay out of pocket after the insurance have kick in ) .  Rather , it be an artifact of our system of third-party payment , in which employer and the government , not beneficiary , pay for health insurance and care .  Such a model would be an enormous improvement over the current system , and dramatically less expensive .  The way in which those Americans who have insurance coverage receive and use it explain a lot about why health-care cost be so high , and why so many people be uninsured .  One of the main finding of this experiment be that family with the least generous plan ( those who have to pay a full 95 % of their cost out of pocket , up to a cap ) spend nearly 30 % less on medical carewith little or no difference in their health .  The reason health insurance be different be federal policy .  Since the 1950s , money that an employer spend on an employee 's health insurance have be exclude from the employee 's taxable income ( despite the indisputable fact that employer-provided health insurance be income ) .  ( This be necessary not only on ground of fairness , but also because if subsidy be available only to the uninsured , insured people would drop their insurance to be able to take advantage of government support .

***** While emphasise this dimension of the US climate denial movement , this article also aim to show the complexity of the movement , rather than the mere defence of the narrowly-defined and short-term economic interest of the oil and gas industry , by shed light on two additional factor which have be instrumental in block strong climate action .  First , climate denial stem from the strong ideological commitment of small-government conservative and libertarian to laisser-faire and their strong opposition to regulation .  Second , in order to disarm their opponent , US climate denier often rest their case on the defence of the American way of life , define by high consumption and ever-expanding material prosperity .  It be the contention of this article , therefore , that the US climate denial movement be best understood a a combination of these three trend .  climate change , conservatism , consumerism , ecology , environmentalism , free market , global warming , ideology , libertarianism , Republican party , think tank .  ) 3 Among the most prominent think tank involve in the climate change denial movement be the Americ ( .  ) 1 The ideological underpinning of climate change denial in the United States merit close scrutiny than it have receive to date .

***** It be one of a number of tactic use in climate change denial to attempt to manufacture political and public controversy dispute this consensus .  As state by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the large contributor to global warming be the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) since 1750 , particularly from fossil fuel combustion , cement production , and land use change such a deforestation .  Human influence have be detect in warm of the atmosphere and the ocean , in change in the global water cycle , in reduction in snow and ice , in global mean sea level rise , and in change in some climate extreme .  9 Despite this scientific consensus on climate change , allegation have be make that scientist and institution involve in global warming research be part of a global scientific conspiracy or engage in a manipulative hoax .  In 2002 , after Clive Hamilton criticize Lavoisier Group , the Cooler Heads Coalition publish an article support the Lavoisier Group 's conspiracy theory that hundred of climate scientist have twist their result to support the climate change theory in order to protect their research funding .  So when these researcher do climate change study in the late 90 's they be eager to produce finding that would be important and be widely notice and trigger more research funding .  1617 The climate denier involve in Climategate in 2009 claim that researcher fake the data in their research publication and suppress their critic in order to receive more funding ( i .  1819 Some climate change denier claim that there be no scientific consensus on climate change , and they sometimes claim that any evidence that show there be scientific consensus be fake .

Researchers have express relief that the meeting do not fail to produce an agreement , but some leave COP26 dissatisfy at the lack of strong commitment to reduce emission , and failure to agree loss and damage finance for country that be vulnerable to climate change .  COP26 have close the gap , but it have not solve the problem , say Niklas Hoehne , a climate researcher at Wageningen University in the Netherlands .  He add that country now need to come forward with more ambitious pledge to tackle climate change , he add .  Curbing emission The final 11-page document , call the Glasgow Climate Pact , say that greenhouse gas emission must fall by 45 % from 2010 level by 2030 for global warming to be maintain at 1 .  However , follow objection from China and India , a promise in early draft of the text to phase out coal be change to phase down .
***** But the big change be underway more quietly , among young Republicans .  A reporter point out that the midterm , in 2018 , saw a surge in young voter , who be much more likely than old folk to say they want the government to take action on climate change .  The oil and natural gas industry be absolutely commit to climate progress , he say , and we want to help get the message out that no one be invest more in low-carbon technology .  A staunch Republican and former Texas agriculture commissioner , Staples spend his time in office attack proposal to address climate change and once urge the U .

***** Now He 's Awkwardly Boasting About Fighting It President Donald Trump have falsely call climate change a hoax invent by China , incorrectly suggest that wind turbine cause cancer and dismiss a landmark scientific report produce by the federal government own scientist .  His Administration have seek to roll back key climate regulation at every turn .  Trump specifically cite a reduction in climate change-causing carbon dioxide emission and brag that the U .  Every single one of the signatory to the Paris climate accord lag behind America , he say .  But , more significantly , the claim appear to be an acknowledgement by the President that climate change be an actual problem that the United States should be address , something he have previously dismiss .  To be clear , Trump do not make that case explicitly nor do he discuss the threat of climate change in any specific way .  But his claim would make no sense if climate change be a hoax or simply a byproduct of change in the weather , argument that Trump have make in the past .

The more I think about it , the more I become eager to learn about where he be come from , where I be come from , and why our two worldviews clash so strongly in the present social debate over climate science .  Ironically , in his desire to challenge my research , he stimulate a new research stream , one that fit perfectly with my broad research agenda on social , institutional , and cultural change .  Social Consensus Today , there be no doubt that a scientific consensus exist on the issue of climate change .  Scientists have document that anthropogenic source of greenhouse gas be lead to a buildup in the atmosphere , which lead to a general warming of the global climate and an alteration in the statistical distribution of localized weather pattern over long period of time .  Both the US National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science use the word “ consensus ” when describe the state of climate science .

The task of forge a global consensus on transformative mitigation strategy to the climate emergency somehow always elude the participate party , and the result be to keep kick the can down the road a if to say , “ Let future generation take care of the problem .  ” Unfortunately , despite be tout a “ our last best hope ” , the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow end up be just another big flop , thus confirm that people should not expect international climate summit or government to solve the climate crisis .  Indeed , the only hope for solve humanity ’ s great existential crisis lie with our ability to mobilise behind the global climate movement .  Moreover , rich country have fail to honour their pledge to provide $ 100bn each year by 2020 to help poor nation deal with the threat of global warming , and the climate debt grow exponentially .

Social Security has nothing to do with the federal deficit.
***** It can not add to the deficit if the trust fund be exhaust because the law prohibit it from borrow ( if current revenue and saving in the trust fund be not sufficient to pay promised benefit , these have to be cut ) .  As a result , Social Security can not and would not add to the federal deficit when it trust fund be exhaust .  Even if Congress change the law and turn to general revenue to pay promised benefit , this would increase the budget deficit by only about 4-7 % .  While this be more than a drop in the bucket , it would not be a major driver of the federal deficit , unlike rise health care cost or make the Bush tax cut permanent .  The trust fund hold Treasury security similar to those hold by private citizen , business , and government around the world .  Social Security can run a short-run deficit only if it have previously run surplus .  The Social Security shortfall average 4 % of the unified budget deficit each year , or amount to roughly 7 % of the long-term fiscal gap ( the latter method give more weight to later deficit when the economy will be large ) .  Since it be impossible to argue that Social Security be a key driver of the long-term deficit , Fiscal Commission member Alice Rivlin and others claim Social Security cut may be need to “ send a message ” to bond market ( Sopelsa 2010 ; Blinder 2010 ) .

***** Budget Process The federal debt ceiling will be reinstate on August 1 , 2021 , at around $ 28 .  Have policymakers use the debt ceiling to pursue deficit reduction in the past ? .  The debt ceiling be the legal limit on the total amount of federal debt the government can accrue .  The limit apply to almost all federal debt , include the roughly $ 22 .  As a result , the debt continue to rise due to both annual budget deficit finance by borrow from the public and from trust fund surplus , which be invest in Treasury bill with the promise to be repay later with interest .  At that point , give annual deficit , incoming receipt will be insufficient to pay million of daily obligation a they come due .  Therefore , the federal government will have to at least temporarily default on many of it obligation , from Social Security payment and salary for federal civilian employee and the military to veteran ’ benefit and utility bill , among others .

Social Security , establish in 1935 , be the most costly item in the federal budget .  These plan would require borrowing or new federal tax to pay for exist Social Security liability .  The diversion of payroll tax would starve the Social Security system of revenue , force the program to run huge deficit .  To cover these deficit Congress would be force to raise tax or borrow fund .  In the interim , the federal government would need to impose extra tax ( temporarily replace most of the lose Social Security tax ) or sell a large amount of additional public debt .  Instead of enjoy an operating surplus , Social Security will then require a substantial infusion of fund from the Treasury , force the federal government to raise tax , to reduce other spending , or to borrow extra money .  If all the Social Security surplus be divert into individual retirement account , the federal budget deficit would jump $ 66 billion , reduce save in the government sector and force the government to sell more bond .

Failing to lift the limit would force the federal government to renege on commitment it have already make , simply because Washington can not maintain the status quo in federal program without borrow more money ( and go deeply into the red ) .  The recession trigger by the COVID-19 pandemic be partly responsible for this budget gap , a be the federal government ’ s multitrillion-dollar relief effort .

***** Discussions about reduce America ’ s federal budget deficit often include heat argument about Social Security .  they presume that Social Security benefit be “ unsustainable ” and cut in future promise benefit be necessary to improve federal government finance .  Legal barrier and the structure of the Social Security Trust Fund make it nearly impossible to use cut in benefit for deficit reduction .

In addition , deficit be a deeply rooted symbol in American history , the meaning of which have change over time , but that continually relate to distrust of the national government .  Today , the same causal claim lead many to condemn deficit a a cause of the low rate of national saving .

Instead of yield to the incessant , extreme Republican demand , a the President do during last Decembers tax cut agreement and this year spend negotiation , the President have get to get out of the beltway and rally the American people who already believe that deficit reduction must be about share sacrifice .  Unless the American people by the million tell the President not to yield one inch to Republican demand to destroy Medicare and Medicaid , while continue to provide tax break to the wealthy and the powerful , I be afraid that be exactly what will happen .  So , I be ask the American people who may be listen today that if you believe that deficit reduction should be about share sacrifice , if you believe that it be time for the wealthy and large corporation to pay their fair share , if you believe that we need to reduce unnecessary defense spending , and if you believe that the middle class have already sacrifice enough due to the greed , recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street , the President need to hear your voice , and he need to hear it now .

***** Rising health care cost be project to increasingly dominate the federal budget , a note in Chapter 1 , and they threaten to squeeze out other public need and priority .

Because the charge of this committee be the future of the federal budget , the option present in this chapter focus on the pub- Suggested Citation .  The Congressional Budget Office ( 2009d , 2009i ) project that the propose expansion in insurance coverage would increase net cost by $ 614- $ 891 billion over the next 10 year .

Instead , they emphasize that the health care cost growth curve must be bent downward for the entire system in order to avoid major cost shift from the federal budget to all other payer .  Essentially , each of these step could provide estimable amount of budget saving to keep the total budget within prescribed limit .  We also discuss a range of illustrative reform approach and option below , but uncertainty a to the effect of some of the option make it FIGURE 5-1 Federal health spending under four sustainable budget trajectory and in the baseline .

For year , my research partner and I travel the country from bankruptcy courtroom to bankruptcy courtroom , talk directly to people who ’ d see their life turn upside down .  That ’ s how much an average family of four with employer-sponsored insurance personally spend per year on employee premium contribution and out-of-pocket cost in 2018 .  37 million American adult didn ’ t fill a prescription last year because of cost .  It put $ 11 trillion back in the pocket of American family , and doesn ’ t raise tax on the middle class by even a cent .  These industry will spend freely on shady TV ad and lobby to convince people that a program that save them massive sum of money will somehow cost them money .  That a program that cover more service , more people , and cost the American people less than what we currently spend on health care be somehow too expensive .  Where be the hundred of million be spend so that people who be try to balance a budget around rise health care premium and grow deductible and copays can make their voice hear in Washington ? .  While much of this ambiguity result from the reasonable choice to delegate significant implementation discretion to the Executive Branch , it have also allow opponent of Medicare for All to make up their own price tag and try to scare middle class family about the prospect of tax increase .

***** From 2013 until today , every time the World Happiness Report ( WHR ) have publish it annual ranking of country , the five Nordic country .  Clearly , when it come to the level of average life evaluation , the Nordic state be do something right , but Nordic exceptionalism isn ’ t confine to citizen ’ s happiness .  No matter whether we look at the state of democracy and political right , lack of corruption , trust between citizen , felt safety , social cohesion , gender equality , equal distribution of income , Human Development Index , or many other global comparison , one tend to find the Nordic country in the global top spot .  Through review the exist study , theory , and data behind the World Happiness Report , we find that the most prominent explanation include factor relate to the quality of institution , such a reliable and extensive welfare benefit , low corruption , and well-functioning democracy and state institution .  Furthermore , Nordic citizens experience a high sense of autonomy and freedom , as well a high level of social trust towards each other , which play an important role in determine life satisfaction .  On the other hand , we show that a few popular explanation for Nordic happiness such a the small population and homogeneity of the Nordic country , and a few counterargument against Nordic happiness such a the cold weather and the suicide rate , actually do n't seem to have much to do with Nordic happiness .  For example , do trust in institution and other citizen create a fertile ground for build a welfare state model with extensive social benefit ? .  Or do the welfare state model contribute to low crime and corruption , which lead citizen to trust each other more ? .  Second , there be a myth that in addition to high happiness metric , the Nordic country have high suicide rate , a seeming paradox .  Although wealthy country , such a the Nordics , tend to have high suicide rate than poor country , in general , the same factor that predict high life satisfaction tend to predict low suicide rate .  Thus this seem paradox seem to be base on outdated information , a Nordic suicide rate be not especially high and be well predict by the theoretical model where the same factor contribute to both high life satisfaction in the Nordics and to lower suicide rate .  However , from the point of view of policy-makers interested in replicate the Nordic model , it be not particularly helpful to know just that all of these positive factor be concentrate in the same country ; rather , policy-makers need concrete way to produce high level of happiness , and those can be hard to find .

***** High rate of suicide be often connect with the Nordic country and their apparently ‘ socialist ’ policy .  Highlighting high suicide rate in Scandinavia can be trace back to at least the 1960s when foreign observer attempt to either undermine or legitimize the welfare state in Denmark , Norway and Sweden .  In the 1960s , commentator suggest the behavior of Scandinavian mother , such a dominate child-rearing and go out to work , influence their offspring mental health and lead to high suicide rate .  For the Scandinavian state in the twenty-first century , suicide play a key role in their international image , despite a concurrent reputation for prosperity and stability .  In this image , suicide be often purportedly link with the political structure of the Nordic country , especially the existence of a universal , redistributive welfare state , and be frequently juxtapose with high ranking of international happiness survey .  A New York Post article from 2015 drew upon this image to convince Americans about the undesirability of Scandinavian political lesson give the country ’ issue with alcoholism , use of anti-depressants , and suicide .  This view posit suicide a the expect outcome when individual freedom and initiative be sacrifice for social and economic security , make suicide a particularly Nordic phenomenon to the extent that these country be still treat a be uniquely ’ socialist ’ , often in contrast to the Anglo-American country .  The circulation of this image have lead commentator to frequently question the Nordic country ’ high rank in happiness survey in the face of such seemingly massive unhappiness .  In fact , most study do not indicate a particularly strong tendency towards suicide in the Nordic region .  In OECD data on suicide rate from 2014 to 2017 , the Nordic country appear around or under the median , with only Finland in the top 16 , at number ten .  In all five Nordic countries—with the possible exception of Iceland , where a small populace lead to a great deal of annual variance—suicide rate have fall over the last 40 year .  However , the perpetual focus on these theme in a Nordic context suggest the image of Scandinavian suicide have take on a reality independent of , and even in contrast to , actual condition .  This conception of suicide a a wicked act encourage nineteenth-century Scandinavian government , along with government in the rest of Europe , to begin measure suicide rate a a mean of assess immoral activity .  To some extent , this reflect reality a suicide rate increase in Scandinavia from the 1930s onwards and at a high rate than other country ( at least in Denmark and Sweden ) .  The latter be justify by the high record rate of suicide in country like Denmark and Sweden—although notably not in Norway—than in the United States or the United Kingdom .  Leftist newspaper Information , for example , imply that Norway have a many suicide a Denmark but do not report them a such ( Danmarks Rygte ( Denmark ’ s reputation ) publish in Information on February 25 , 1964 ) .  And while international portrayal of socialist suicide usually no long induce widespread rejoinder , the event of the 1960s remain a demonstration of the extent that foreign opinion can spark Scandinavian act of solidarity—or disassociation .

A second basket of issue be whether , even if the inspection go perfectly and Iran stay in full compliance with the letter and spirit of the agreement , whether it be a good deal or not .  As Secretaries Shultz and Kissinger write back in April , negotiation that begin a an effort to prevent Iran from develop a nuclear arsenal be end with an agreement that concede that very capability , although several year down the road .

On delivery vehicle , the third prong of the nuclear weapon program , the agreement not only do not restrict Iran 's ballistic missile activity , but it appear to remove previous ban on such activity .  So have leave Iran with this nuclear weapon capability , the agreement 's success will depend on detecting and respond to cheating .  And it could even in the future take the form of our ally seek nuclear weapon capability of their own to match and guard against a potential nuclear breakout in Iran .  say it will interdict future transfer , but this seem unlikely because do so could cause Iran to blow up the deal .  For this reason , should Iran decide to acquire nuclear weapon , it would likely attempt to break out use clandestine facility .  The question before you , I think , be whether it be an adequate deal to hold Iran to account .

A stimulus package be a package of economic measure a government invoke to stimulate a flounder economy .  The objective of a stimulus package be to reinvigorate the economy and prevent or reverse a recession by boost employment and spending .  The theory behind the usefulness of a stimulus package be root in Keynesian economics , which argue that recession be not self-correcting ; therefore , government intervention can lessen the impact of a recession .  For example , a stimulus , or increased government spending , can compensate for decreased private spending , thereby boost aggregate demand and close the output gap in the economy .
***** The two most prominent bet be that the bill win ’ t fuel inflation in the near term and that over the long term , future lawmaker will find a way to extend key provision that be schedule to expire in a few year .  From an economic perspective , the big bet be that inject a major new spending plan into an economy that be already run hot will not far fuel the inflationary spike that have see price accelerate by six percent over the past year .  If it do not arrive soon , enactment of another major spending bill , on top of the COVID-19 relief plan pass in March and the bipartisan infrastructure bill pas earlier this month , might not be a well-received a public polling would indicate .  If the Federal Reserve Board be force to combat an inflationary spiral by raise interest rate sooner and high than currently anticipate , this would have a dampening effect on the economy and undercut the case that the BBBA ’ s policy be pro-growth .
***** While campaign , President Donald Trump follow in the footstep of his conservative predecessor by fear-mongering about the ballooning deficit — but when he get to the White House that concern all but seem to disappear when it come to his tax cut for the rich and increased government spending .  In fact , there ’ s a pattern to the Republicans ’ selective concern about increase the deficit , and it all depend on who hold the power .  Let 's say we pass a Green New Deal and we do n't raise tax at all .  We do n't like undo the Trump tax cut .  Nothing change in the tax rate , but we spend a trillion dollar more a year .  A trillion dollar Green New Deal a year would be World War II mobilization level increase .  They just create out of whole cloth a new drug prescription benefit for senior with no revenue stream and it pas by one vote in the house .  Then he 'll turn around two year later , and the Democrats we need a big recovery act or stimulus program because the country ’ s in the bad economic free fall in 70 year , and all of the economist , the macro economist , tell u that we need demand to stimulate the economy , and Paul Ryan vote against it because that blow up the deficit .  Ronald Reagan , small government bad , deficit bad , small government , deficit explodes , military funding explodes , and tax be cut , big deficit .  Infamously vote for a bill that raise tax to close the deficit , and he be throw out of the conservative movement , and view a a traitor evermore .  Leave office with the bad financial crisis in 70 year and an exploding deficit and debt .
***** It be intend to help lawmaker make the tax and mandatory spending change necessary to meet the level propose in the Congressional budget resolution .  The reconciliation instruction identify the authorize committee ( s ) task with reconciliation , the dollar amount of budgetary change that must be achieve over designated time frame ( usually the first year of the budget and the five- or ten-year period cover by the budget resolution ) that the committee ( s ) must achieve , and the date by which the committee ( s ) must report reconciliation legislation .  If only one committee have reconciliation instruction , the reconciliation legislation report by that committee go directly to the House or Senate floor for consideration .  As with any other bill , deficit increase under reconciliation be subject to the statutory PAYGO law , which do not allow net increase in the deficit over the course of a year or the following five-year and ten-year period .  An exclusion from statutory PAYGO a part of a reconciliation bill would be subject to a 60-vote point of order .  In 2017 , a December continue resolution enact on the same day a the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act remove the tax cut from the statutory PAYGO scorecard .  If PAYGO have not be waive , the resulting sequester would have be large enough to eliminate mandatory program that be subject to the sequester .
***** And with Democrats in control of the presidency , a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate , and a large majority in the House , they opt to pass a grand total of $ 787 billion of stimulus .  Within two year , even a unemployment sit near double digit , Barack Obama pivot to deficit reduction .  Twelve year later , America ’ s unemployment rate sits at 6 .  Thanks to the CARES Act ’ s relief check , the Fed ’ s interest-rate cut and support for market , and this year ’ s COVID-induced contraction on consumption opportunity , most U .

Colleges and university have support the aid in the hope of soften state funding cut to high education a they try to fill billion of dollar in budget shortfall .  The bill feature $ 37 billion , include $ 27 billion from a $ 90 billion state fiscal stabilization , in a fund that would also support K-12 education .  5 billion would go to college and university to help with pandemic-related cost , include $ 1 .
***** Republicans would prefer a small relief bill if they provide any at all , with principled skepticism about government spending now align with a cynical lack of interest in see Biden preside over an economic boom .  As one veteran of Obama-era battle tell me , it ’ ll be “ trench warfare on appropriation and debt limit ” start with the expiration of government funding this December and continue to August ’ s statutory debt ceiling .  After all , when Donald Trump become president , one of the Republican Party ’ s key policy objective be to cut long-term Medicare spending .  Mitch McConnell simply pivot to the theory that once Republicans be do cut tax , entitlement reform would have to be do on a bipartisan basis , seemingly conclude from the Trump experience that a one-party approach to these issue be less viable than he and Paul Ryan think in the Obama era .  These could add up to a scenario where Republicans insist on spending cut in government funding deal while Democrats argue that deficit reduction should feature tax increase too in order to be balance and fair .  This would exacerbate party tension on the Democratic side , make it essentially impossible for a Biden administration to solve any big problem , and very likely founder on the basic reality that Republicans be fanatically oppose to tax the rich .  There be an alternative to “ eat your pea ” politics — a push for a different kind of bipartisan deal in which , rather than give up on progressive spending priority , Biden try to secure support for them by give in to big , GOP-friendly tax cut .
***** I 've argue on many occasion that one of the big lesson we need to learn from this recession be that state-level balance budget requirement be highly destabilizing .  When a recession hit , spending go up for social service and tax fall a income , sale , property value , and other source of revenue for state and local government decline .  The result be a big hole in state and local government budget , and that force either increase in tax or cut in spend both of which make thing even bad .

But , by relegate the onus of deficit reduction to spending cut rather than tax increase , the proposal risk severe cut to investment and a costly , counterproductive expansion of tax expenditure .

He withhold $ 391 million in military aid .  Some ask , why not take more time ? .  I hope that we be able to work together to hold this President , or any President , accountable for break his most basic obligation to the country and to it citizen .  When his time have pas , when his grip on our politics be go , when our country return , a surely it will , to calmer time and strong leadership , history will look back on our action here today .  We have each take an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemy , foreign and domestic .

***** I could not understand what you be say .  When Congress find out about this scheme and begin to investigate , President Trump take extraordinary and unprecedented step to cover up his effort and to withhold evidence from the investigator .  When his own Justice Department try to uncover the extent to which a foreign government have break our law , President Trump take extraordinary and unprecedented step to obstruct the investigation , include ignore subpoena , order the creation of false record , and publicly attack and intimidate witness .  He implore u to see the nature of the threat to our country .  Since the founding of our country , the House of Representatives have impeach only two Presidents .  The patriot who find our country be not fearful men .  How will we know if the President have betray his country in this manner ? .

If an individual is determined to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor because they will find a way.
***** Psychology can make important contribution to policy that prevent gun violence .  Toward this end , in February 2013 the American Psychological Association commission this report by a panel of expert to convey research-based conclusion and recommendation ( and to identify gap in such knowledge ) on how to reduce the incidence of gun violence — whether by homicide , suicide , or mass shoot — nationwide .  More information and support citation can be find within the chapter themselves .  Developmental Issues A complex and variable constellation of risk and protective factor make person more or less likely to use a firearm against themselves or others .  For this reason , there be no single profile that can reliably predict who will use a gun in a violent act .  Instead , gun violence be associate with a confluence of individual , family , school , peer , community , and sociocultural risk factor that interact over time during childhood and adolescence .  Although many youth desist in aggressive and antisocial behavior during late adolescence , others be disproportionately at risk for become involve in or otherwise affect by gun violence .  Prevention effort can also reduce the relatively rare occasion when severe mental illness contributes to homicide or the more common circumstance when depression or other mental illness contributes to suicide .  Reducing incident of gun violence arise from criminal misconduct or suicide be an important goal of broad primary and secondary prevention and intervention strategy .  Such strategy must also attend to redirect developmental antecedent and large sociocultural process that contribute to gun violence and gun-related death .  Gun Violence Prediction and Prevention at the Individual Level Although it be important to recognize that most people suffer from a mental illness be not dangerous , for those person at risk for violence due to mental illness , suicidal thought , or feeling of desperation , mental health treatment can often prevent gun violence .  Policies to Reduce Gun Violence The use of a gun greatly increase the odds that violence will lead to a fatality .  This be a common misconception , because prevention do not require prediction of a specific individual ’ s behavior .

Department of Health and Human Services from fund research that could be see a promote gun control .  The review exclude study that rely on survey data to estimate gun ownership and focus instead on study that include more specific information about whether victim have access to gun .  All but two of the study be do in the United States , where gun ownership be high than anywhere else in the world and firearm cause an estimate 31,000 death each year .  Since not all of the study as whether victim have firearm in their home , the meta-analysis do not draw conclusion about the association between suicide or homicide and the location of the firearm , but merely whether victim have access to them .

***** 1093/aje/kwh309 Abstract Data from a US mortality follow-back survey be analyze to determine whether have a firearm in the home increase the risk of a violent death in the home and whether risk varies by storage practice , type of gun , or number of gun in the home .  Those person with gun in the home be at great risk than those without gun in the home of die from a homicide in the home ( adjust odds ratio = 1 .  The risk of die from a suicide in the home be great for male in home with gun than for male without gun in the home ( adjust odds ratio = 10 .  Persons with gun in the home be also more likely to have die from suicide commit with a firearm than from one commit by use a different method ( adjust odds ratio = 31 .  Results show that regardless of storage practice , type of gun , or number of firearm in the home , have a gun in the home be associate with an increase risk of firearm homicide and firearm suicide in the home .  firearm ; homicide ; suicide ; violence ; wound and injuriesReceived for publication February 9 , 2004 ; accept for publication June 7 , 2004 .  Over 50,000 homicide and suicide occur each year in the United States ( 1 ) , make them among the lead cause of death , particularly for young people .  In 2001 , homicide be the second leading cause of death and suicide the third for person 15 .  Approximately 60 percent of all homicide and suicide in the United States be commit with a firearm ( 2 ) .  Although an estimated 40 percent of adult in the United States report keep a gun in the home for recreational or protective purpose ( 3 ) , the risk and benefit of this practice be widely dispute in the literature ( 4 , 5 ) .  Ecologic analysis have suggest a link between the prevalence of gun ownership and rate of homicide and suicide ( 6 .  Although these study be useful in demonstrate an association between access to firearm and rate of homicide and suicide at the aggregate level , it be not possible with this methodology to adequately assess whether access to a gun increase the risk of a violent death at the individual level .  However , study conduct in other country have fail to find a clear link between access to a firearm and risk of a suicide ( 22 ) .  Those person with gun in the home be at significantly great risk than those without gun in the home of die from a firearm suicide versus one commit by use other mean ( adjust odds ratio = 31 .  The finding show an increase risk of homicide in home with gun be also consistent with previous research ( 14 , 20 , 23 , 24 ) , although , when compare with suicide , be not a strong .  Our finding also suggest that the presence of a gun in the home increase the chance that a homicide or suicide in the home will be commit with a firearm rather than by use other mean .  Victims of suicide living in home with gun be more than 30 time more likely to have die from a firearm-related suicide than from one commit with a different method .  Guns be highly lethal , require little preparation , and may be choose over less lethal method to commit suicide , particularly when the suicide be impulsive .  Suicidal person may also be more likely to acquire a gun to commit suicide and , give the lethality of the weapon , be more likely to complete suicide , although the evidence on this point be mix ( 20 .  For victim of homicide , there be also a strong association between gun in the home and risk of die from a firearm-related homicide , but this risk vary by age and whether the person be live with others at the time of death .  In our study , the risk of die from a firearm-related homicide or suicide be great in home with gun , but this risk do not vary by specific firearm-related characteristic .  Second , the gun in the home may not have be the gun use in the death .  This possibility seem less likely with suicide , but , with homicide , it be certainly plausible that someone bring a gun into the home .  Third , it be possible that the association between a gun in the home and risk of a violent death may be relate to other factor that we be unable to control for in our analysis .

***** Empirical research on the causal effect of firearm availability on the risk of suicide be consistent with the claim that firearms increase suicide risk , but this research can not yet rule out some other explanation for observe association between gun and suicide .  There be , however , theoretical or logical argument for believe firearm elevate suicide risk that be sufficiently compel that individual and policymakers might reasonably choose to assume that gun availability do increase the risk of suicide .  States , region , and country with high rate of household gun ownership have high rate of gun suicide .  There be also cross-sectional , ecological association between gun ownership and overall risk of suicide , but this association be more modest than the association between gun ownership and gun suicide ; it be less consistently observe across time , place , and person ; and the causal relation remain unclear .  The risk of suicide be high immediately after the purchase of a handgun , suggest that some firearm be specifically purchase for the purpose of commit suicide .  If firearm be available to a person who be think about take his or her life , the presence of firearm might be link with a high likelihood of suicide and high regional suicide rate .  In this essay , we examine the empirical evidence on the relationship between firearm availability ( or prevalence ) and suicide .  We categorize these study a those that examine association between individual access to firearm and suicide rate and those that examine association between the regional prevalence of firearm and suicide rate in census region , state , and city .  Individual Access to Firearms A primary conclusion of the NRC report be that although there be limitation of study that examine suicide outcome among those with access to gun ( e .  , gun purchaser ) or those that look at firearm ownership among suicide decedent relative to some other group , these research approach have generally be “ underutilized in the literature ” ( NRC , 2004 , p .  those that examine suicide risk among gun owner and those that examine firearm access among suicide decedent .  Whether the mere availability of a gun increase the risk of suicide be a complex question to disentangle from observational data because some of the association between gun accessibility and suicide be likely attributable to the fact that those who wish to kill themselves may go out of their way to procure a gun or otherwise ensure that a gun be accessible .  Others with access to gun may be at high risk of suicide because their attempt to kill themselves with an available gun be more likely to be fatal than if they have use a less lethal mean , such a poison or drug overdose .  The next-best source of rigorous evidence , quasi-experimental observational study , may never be able to adequately control for the myriad , sometimes intersect , reason why individual might want gun available and might also wish to kill themselves .  A concern with all such study be the possibility that case and control may not be match on important characteristic that influence both the person ’ s decision to acquire firearm and his or her risk of suicide .  The difference could suggest that gun access increase the risk of suicide , or they could suggest that people who be suicidal may obtain gun at a high rate because they be consider kill themselves with gun .  An individual feeling suicidal may acquire a firearm a a mean to take his or her life and thus make the weapon readily available in the household .  Other work have use different control group to attempt to address this selection bias ( that suicidal people be more likely to acquire gun so that they can kill themselves ) .  Although suicide attempt and ideation be not reliable proxy of suicide risk , these study do yield insight into the difference in suicidality between those who have access to gun and those who do not .  Among those who die by suicide , those live with a gun in the home be more likely to take their life use a gun than other mean .

And while price for LED light bulb be astronomical when we first cover this topic just a few year ago — upwards of $ 100 for one bulb — you can now pick up a cheap , 60-watt-equivalent LED light bulb for less than $ 5 .  That ’ s probably why incandescent light bulb be be phase out .  As incandescent light bulb around the country burn out for the last time , let ’ s look at the other option available .  Let ’ s examine the two most popular new light bulb option , CFLs and LEDs , and look at the advantage and disadvantage that come with each .  LEDs When most people need to replace their light bulb , cost be the big factor in their decision .  And then there ’ s the cost of the electricity use to light the bulb .  If you replace 20 incandescent bulb with LED light bulb throughout your home , you could save up to $ 3,260 over their 23-year lifespan ( and that ’ s assume utility rate don ’ t rise ) .  Use less energy than incandescent bulb Cost less than LED light bulb Produce extremely bright light that spread evenly Available in soft , warm , and bright white hue Cons .  Sometime in the very near future , you probably win ’ t be able to buy any more incandescent light bulb , even if you want to .
***** LED v CFL The switch from incandescent light bulb to the energy-saving compact fluorescent lamp ( CFL ) be something that many household be still make decision on , and the LED v CFL debate be one that many of u be familiar with .  There be a few thing to think about , and many people look to maintain the same ( or high ) level of efficiency when choose to switch to a different type of bulb , as well a light bulb run cost .  Identifying your light bulb run cost can seem confusing , so we have create a guide which outline the run cost of each type of bulb .  First , it be important to understand the difference between the two type of bulb to understand how they work and the benefit of each to get a true understanding of each light bulb run cost .  The key difference between LED and CFL bulb be the way in which they create light .  LED light bulb produce light cause by an electrical current , whereas CFL bulb generate ultraviolet light and heat which , in turn , generates light when it hit the bulb phosphor interior .  This process can generally take up to three minute to complete , which be why it take long for energy save bulb to become fully lit .  LED light bulb give off very little heat in comparison to CFL bulb which release about 80 % of their energy a heat .  It 's worth consider that the upfront cost of your light bulb be n't the final cost , and that the cheap initial cost do n't guarantee long-term saving .
***** > Electricity > The real cost of light your home The real cost of light your home Posted by Brendon O'Neill 08/08/2016 It ’ s easy to overlook how much your light cost to run .  Well , that depend on the type of bulb you have instal .  Here we take a look at four common type of residential light bulb and see just how much they ’ re add to your electricity bill .  Types of light bulb There be a number of type of light bulb suitable for different application , be it outdoor , downlight , lamp or ceiling .  Focusing for the moment on interior ceiling light , there be four type of light bulb that you might find around a typical household .  incandescent light bulb , halogen light bulb , compact fluorescent light ( CFLs ) and light emit diode ( LEDs ) .  These light bulb be simple and cheap , but very inefficient to run .  While LED bulb be more expensive to purchase , they ’ re generally the most efficient bulb , require little electricity to produce just as much light a other bulb .  Keep in mind that this doesn ’ t factor in the bulb purchase cost or how often you will need to replace them .  The final word on light cost While energy save light bulb be often more expensive upfront , Sustainability Victoria and other energy save website advocate that CFL and LED light will usually save you money in the long term .
***** ShapeBy Tom RichmanSuppose you invent a light bulb that , for all practicall purpose , never burn out .  5 billion incandescent light bulb be sell every year in the United States .  Most of them be rat at 750 or 1,000 hour of life , which be to say that if a group of them be burn continuously , roughly half would fail in less than two month , and half would burn long .  It cost General Electric Co .  , the market leader , less than a quarter to make such a bulb .  It cost DioLight Technology Inc .  to make a bulb that retail for $ 4 .  DioLight 's bulb cost the customer less than seven time as much to buy a GE 's , yet it burn 60 time a long .  Kevin Keating , co-inventor of the bulb and founder of DioLight , assume that a light bulb that good would be easy to sell .  Making the bulb , they decide , would pose no serious technical problem .  How do you sell a light bulb that never burn out ? .
***** Donate Types of light bulbsLEDs LED bulb be the most efficient and durable of the lot , but also the most expensive .  They use up to 80 percent less energy than incandescent bulb , while produce the same amount of light .  CFLs A compact fluorescent lamp ( CFL ) be a scaled-down version of the fluorescent tube light common in office and commercial building .  CFLs be generally cheap than LEDs and have a lifetime of at least 6000 hour , about six time long than incandescents but significantly short than LEDs .  Halogen lamps Halogen lamp be a type of incandescent bulb , but be about 30 percent more efficient .  Incandescent bulb Incandescents be the direct descendant of the first light bulb patent by Thomas Edison in 1879 .  Watts measure power consumption , whereas lumens measure light output .  We find there be considerable variation in the efficiency of LED bulb .  Generally , LEDs produce the same amount of light a an incandescent bulb that have five to six time the wattage .  AGLS bulb be now available in the 40W to 100W equivalent range .  If you want to replace an exist incandescent bulb with an LED , use the wattage of the old incandescent a a guide .  The packaging of LEDs usually indicate the equivalent wattage of incandescent bulb that produce a similar brightness .  If you want to buy an LED to replace a standard incandescent bulb , chance be the LED will appear brighter than the equivalent incandescent .  the bulb be fix to the fitting and can ’ t be change like a regular light bulb .  Energy saving and payback time Despite the high upfront cost of LEDs compare to other technology , you can expect to save money in the long run through reduction in your power bill .  We have n't factor in the cost of the bulb because although energy saver bulb be more expensive than ordinary bulb they last much long , so overall bulb cost be approximately the same .  The direction of the light a it leave the bulb be very different for an incandescent versus a LED light .
***** The humble light bulb .  Over the past decade , traditional incandescent bulb , those distinctive glass orb with glow wire center , have be rapidly replace by more energy-efficient lighting .  The energy save be expect to grow a highly efficient and increasingly inexpensive LED bulb continue to replace old light .  Last month , the Department of Energy say it would withdraw an Obama-era regulation that nearly double the number of light bulb subject to energy-efficiency requirement .  ( The chart above show change for basic , pear-shaped bulb that be regulate by current rule .  Other bulb style , include globe , candelabra and reflector bulb , as well a outdoor lighting , be not include .  Starting in 2012 , the law require new light bulb to use 28 percent less power than exist incandescent light — essentially end the sale of the old , inefficient bulb .  Davis say , because of the short lifespan of traditional light bulb .  Improved halogen incandescents use up to 30 percent less energy than traditional light bulb and can last three time a long .  LED bulb , or light emit diode , use up to 85 percent less energy than traditional bulb and can last for 25 year , without some of the drawback of compact fluorescent .
***** Ever wonder how much that light bulb be cost you ? .  Is it really worth switch to LED bulb ? .  All you need to find out be the bulb 's wattage and the cost of electricity in your building .  Replacing your incandescent bulb with energy-efficient option typically save a few dollar in the first year , and more over a long period of time .  The wattage be often print directly on the bulb a a number follow by a W .  If you do n't see it there , check the packaging the bulb be sell in .  The watt be a unit of power , measure the energy the bulb use each second .  You want the actual number of watt the bulb use .  A typical incandescent bulb draw 60 watt of power , or 60 / 1000 = 0 .  A typical fluorescent bulb use 15 watt , or 15 / 1000 = 0 .  This bulb only use ¼ as much power a the bulb in example 1 , since 15 / 60 = ¼ .  To calculate your utility bill , you 'll need to know how much you use your bulb .  Department of Energy , which provide resource relate to energy safety , conservation , and efficiency Go to source Although other energy saver will have a large effect , replace incandescent bulb be always worth it in the long term .  LED light bulb be even more efficient , and can produce the same brightness for less than 8 watt of power .  Helpful Not Helpful A light bulb make for a high voltage than your socket will use less wattage than state on the label .  This will slightly reduce the kilowatt-hours use , but the light output will be dim and yellow .  For tip on how to calculate the cost of your light bulb 's kilowatt usage , scroll down .

In this section , we ’ ll address each of the major consideration involve in select the right bulb for each of your main light fixture .  When shop for new bulb , be sure to look to the Lighting Facts label require on most common screw-based lamp .  To qualify , lamps must comply with specification on energy use , light output , lamp life , and other operate characteristic .  Light Output The familiar wattages we ’ ve all use to select light bulb since we be kid be become obsolete with the phase-out of traditional incandescent bulb and wide adoption of lamp that use very different amount of power to provide similar level of light .  While most manufacturer label their halogen incandescent , CFL , and LED lamp with the equivalent incandescent wattage— 40W , 60W , 75W , and 100W , it be useful to know how the different wattage translate in term of light output ( or lumens ) .  Moving forward , lumen will replace wattage a the key characteristic for identify the right light bulb .  This make a lot of sense ; after all , when you purchase a light bulb you ’ re look to get a specific amount of light , not a prescribed power consumption .

The lamp use a tube that be curve or fold to fit into the space of an incandescent bulb , and a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp .  Compared to general-service incandescent lamp give the same amount of visible light , CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power , and last eight to fifteen times longer .  A CFL have a high purchase price than an incandescent lamp , but can save over five time it purchase price in electricity cost over the lamp 's lifetime .  electron that be bind to mercury atom be excite to state where they will radiate ultraviolet light a they return to a low energy level ; this emitted ultraviolet light be convert into visible light a it strike the fluorescent coating , and into heat when absorb by other material such a glass .  Improved phosphor formulation have improve the perceived color of the light emit by CFLs , such that some source rate the best `` soft white `` CFLs a subjectively similar in color to standard incandescent lamp .  1 Spectrum of light 3 .  6 Circular and U-shaped lamp be devise to reduce the length of fluorescent light fixture .  31 So , presume the illumination provide by the lamp be ample at the beginning of it life , and the light output of a bulb gradually decrease by 25 % , viewer will perceive a much small change in light intensity .  An analysis of the impact of a ban on incandescent light bulb at that time introduce the notion that in such area , heat generate by conventional electric light bulb may have be significantly reduce the release of greenhouse gas from natural gas heating .
***** Will energy efficient light bulbs cost $ 50 each next year ? .  Some light emit diode bulb may cost that much , but some halogen incandescent bulb and compact fluorescent bulb go for about $ 1 .  FULL QUESTION In 2012 , will 100-watt incandescent light bulbs no longer be available in the U .  Will a fluorescent bulb of equal brightness cost $ 50 ? .  FULL ANSWER The phase out of the conventional , pear-shaped incandescent light bulb in favor of energy-saving bulb officially begin next January with the 100-watt bulb .  50 per bulb for the more efficient halogen incandescent or compact fluorescent variety , or as much a $ 50 per bulb for LEDs , or light emit diode , to replace the 100-watt bulb .  The Energy Department say that while the more efficient bulb will cost more up front than the old model , they will actually save buyer money in the long run .  While the initial price of the new light bulb be typically high than the inefficient incandescent bulb you be replace , youll spend less each year to operate them .
***** `` The new light bulb will cost roughly six time the cost of the light bulb we now use .  BARELY TRUE Is the government go to force you to buy light bulb that cost $ 50 ? .  That 's just one claim from opponent of new light bulb efficiency standard .  We be fact-checking several claim from the fundraising letter circulate by AmeriPAC , a conservative political action committee , and the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise ( CDFE ) Action Fund , which seek contribution and support for a bill to repeal the light bulb efficiency standard include in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 .  In this item , we will address the group ' claim that the law will force consumer to buy light bulb that be significantly more expensive than conventional light bulb sell today .  The group contend that the law -- which be be roll out in phase -- will `` outlaw `` incandescent light bulb in favor of compact fluorescent bulb .  `` Democrats in Congress pas legislation that raise the cost of a single light bulb to $ 50 .  The curly-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb use about 75 percent less electricity than comparable incandescent bulb and last about 10 time long , accord to an analysis by the Department of Energy .  36 be reduce energy cost to the customer over the 1,000-hour life of the bulb , he say .  But when you factor in the cost of electricity need to power the light bulb , they will end up cost significantly less .
***** Recent innovation have bring u all kind of new light technology .  From lightbulb design to react to sound wave ( yep ) to those intend to fight off deadly bacteria ( seriously , this be a real thing ) , what use to be a simple source of light continue to evolve .  But when you simply need a new bulb for your bedside lamp , how do you know that you be make the right decision ? .  The simple fact be that LEDs bulb use 75 % less energy than incandescent lighting .  Incandescent bulb - These be the old-fashioned , “ typical ” bulbs that many of u grow up with .  Compact fluorescent lightbulb ( CFLs ) - These be the “ spiral ” bulb that may come to mind when we think about energy-efficient bulb .  LEDs - LED bulb be very energy-efficient but still maintain the look and feel of an incandescent bulb .  But it ’ s LED bulb that we really think you should be pay attention to .  The initial cost of an LED use to be about double what an incandescent bulb cost .  But the cost have be come down , and now it ’ s hard to find bulb that aren ’ t LEDs .
***** Some business owner don ’ t like the look of twisty compact fluorescent bulb ( CFLs ) , or they find LEDs and CFLs light too glaringly bright .  Higher upfront cost of new light technology scare away others .  The price of many energy-efficient bulb , include CFLs and LEDs , have fall substantially .  Payback time of many light upgrade be now under two or three year .  Not to mention that inefficient light emit much of their energy a heat rather than actual light .  So they can drive up air-conditioning cost in the summer month .  Here ’ s a look at the potential cost saving of make the switch .

Watts still matter , but not so much in determine the brightness of an energy-saving light bulb .  Energy-Saving Light bulbsWhat be the most energy-efficient light bulb ? .  LED bulb be the most efficient light bulb available , use just a tenth of the energy of an incandescent bulb .
***** CFLs be fluorescent lamp that emit light from a mix of phosphor inside the bulb , and be design to replace incandescent lamp ( a lamp that produce light a a result of be heat ) .  When compare to an incandescent bulb produce the same amount of light , CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power , and last eight to fifteen times longer .  A light-emitting diode , or LED for short , be a lamp that emit light in a very narrow band of wavelength .  Because of this , LED ’ s be far more energy efficient than incandescent or fluorescent light , which emit light in a much wide band of wavelength .  LED ’ s produce light that render a color similar ( but not identical ) to natural daylight , which be measure on a scale call CRI , or Color Rendering Index .  Like incandescent lamp and unlike most fluorescent lamp , LEDs come to full brightness without need for a warm-up time .  On average , an incandescent bulb may last around 1000 hour , while a fluorescent ( CFL ) bulb produce the same amount of light ( in Lumens ) may last around 8,000 hour , and an equivalent LED bulb may last around 25,000 hour .
***** id=448100748896598 & ev=PageView & noscript=1 `` > How much energy do a light bulb use , and how do light affect your electricity bill ? .  In this article , I ’ m go to use the analogy of equate electricity to water .  This be a common analogy that we can ’ t claim a our own , but hopefully our specific example will help explain how much energy light really u .  You ’ ve probably make a lot of light decision base on wattage .  You unscrew a burn out light bulb and look at the top and see “ 60W .  ” All you have be a light bulb label “ 25W , ” so you screw it in , and to your dismay , it ’ s way too dim .  You go to the store and pick out a “ 60W ” bulb .
***** Did you know that light account for about one-third of an average home ’ s energy use ? .  When I first read that number , I be shock and quickly run through my home turn off all the light .  Sitting in the dark all day be not ideal but choose the right light bulb can both drastically reduce power bill and positively affect the environment .  So , how do you know which bulb to use ? .  Buying a light bulb be not as simple a it use to be .  For me , walk down the light bulb aisle at a store feel whelm with all the option and rating to consider .  the light bulb that have be the main source of light for the past 200 year .  Clearly , the cost save from switch to efficient light source can result in a low power bill .  Since LEDs use so much less electricity than other bulb and convert it mostly into light , they stay cool to the touch , which reduce the risk of fire and/or burn .  In the future , it will be important to know how these different wattage translate in term of light output ( or lumens ) a this will replace wattage a the key characteristic for identify light bulb .
***** Since 2014 , government regulation have be push consumer to replace familiar incandescent light bulb with more energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamp ( CFL ) and light-emitting diode ( LED ) bulb .  Knowing how different kind of light bulb stack up against each other will help you not only get the right light for any give space but also save energy in the process .  Understanding energy-efficient light bulb When consider a CFL v .  an LED bulb to replace an incandescent one , it help to understand the basic difference in the three major light bulb technology on the market today .  Incandescent bulb be the familiar pear-shaped or round screw-in light bulb that have be market since Thomas Edison perfect the carbon filament bulb in 1879 .  CFL ( compact fluorescent lamp ) bulb be commonly manufacture a a spiral tube connect to a screw-in ballast or base .  Newer technology replace the curly light bulb with one that look like the traditional incandescent bulb .  LED ( light-emitting diode ) bulb be a new technology .  LED bulb In the CFL v .  LED battle for energy efficiency , life span and cost , the winner be the LED bulb .  We ’ ve come a long way in energy-efficient light bulb technology .  With advanced LED and CFL bulb , however , the amount of energy use isn ’ t a important a the amount of light ( lumen ) provide .  Why have no one ever talk about the heat a incandescent bulb give off , that would reduce the cost of heat your home .  Given the number of fixture that exist and use these sort of bulb ( and the fact that such fixture typically use multiple bulb ) , the use of LEDs have the potential to result in HUGE saving in term of electricity use for light .  In my honest opinion , the cost of the lead bulb just doesnt ring up to save that be the worth the purchase .  You might not wish to replace all of your bulb with LEDs at the same time because of the cost , but be hopeful that perhaps people will gradually replace their traditional bulb with energy-efficient alternative like LEDs .
***** One item you probably don ’ t think twice about be your light bulb .  Do light bulbs use a lot of electricity ? .  While individual bulb consume small amount of electricity ( around 40 watt ) , the tricky part be that you probably have a lot of them in the house , so the cost quickly add up .  Just think about every room of your house and count the number of bulb you have .  Each light bulb you buy will have it wattage display on the box so you can quickly tell how much energy will it consume .  For example , if you keep a 60-watt incandescent bulb on for an hour , it will burn , well 60 watt .  However , that do not mean that it will give you the same amount of light , a another 60-watt bulb .  Different Bulbs Use Different Amounts of Energy There be generally three type of light bulb .  Individual light bulb win ’ t use a lot of energy , but the cost can quickly add up .  Leaving one light bulb on during the night will probably not make a dent in your wallet , but you shouldn ’ t get into the habit of leave light on at all time .  Although the energy cost of leave one bulb on for the day isn ’ t high , these cost can quickly add up .
***** A `` normal light bulb `` be also know a an incandescent light bulb .  These bulb have a very thin tungsten filament that be house inside a glass sphere .  The basic idea behind these bulb be simple .  The heat be enough to make the filament white hot , and the `` white `` part be light .  Advertisement The problem with incandescent light bulb be that the heat waste a lot of electricity .  Heat be not light , and the purpose of the light bulb be light , so all of the energy spend create heat be a waste .
Emory University students were provided counseling after someone wrote Trump 2016 in chalk on campus.
***** 246 Activism can be a powerful tool to raise the consciousness of the entire campus community , Senior Vice President and Dean of Campus Life Ajay Nair write in an email to the Wheel , in response to the March 21 Trump chalk protest .  This be how we teach our student to lead beyond the ivory tower .  Nair ’ s positive response to the student activism , which he call “ an effective strategy to gain the attention of the campus community on very difficult issue , ” reflect general administrative sentiment .  ” He say that college campus should encourage activism a a form of expression of concern that will ultimately better the community .  “ I think the best step forward would be for administrator to engage in discussion with the student , ” he say .  While Assistant Vice President for Community Suzanne Onorato say that her value do not align with those that Trump espouses , she do not immediately realize the extent to which the chalkings could affect people when she first saw them on campus .  “ They want to know why Im not contact them directly when these issue happen , why be not reach out to student , what we can do good .  ” Nair acknowledge that , historically , the burden of advance racial justice in high education institution have disproportionately fall to student of color .  “ We rarely account for or honor the life and labor of these student and their enormous contribution to transform our community .  ” Upon speak with student protester at a March 22 meeting in the Centro Latino , Onorato felt that she gain great insight into the pain that some student experience a a result of the chalkings .  She and the student develop action step that emphasize great communication and transparency between administrator and the Emory community , such a increase point of administrative contact and foster awareness of minority issue within the Emory community .  We need to make sure our student be hear .  Because Some Emory University student in pain after Trump 2016 chalk on campus Emory University Students Think Donald Trump Is Out to Kill Them proud to be an emory student .
***** Backlash be mount against Emory student who protest pro-Trump chalk message .  A group of student , many of them minority student , hold a protest Monday at Emory University over chalked message that appear at many place on campus over the weekend in support of Donald Trumps presidential campaign .  The Internet have not be kind to the student ( or Emory ) .  The demonstration , in which student reportedly say the chalkings make them feel unsafe , eventually move from the quad to the administration building in search of James Wagner , Emorys president .

***** In China there be no such thing a the rule of law .  I would be very interested in hear the witness talk a little bit about what have happen since December 2018 , since our study .  I 've be try to unpack some of the recommendation that some of you have make .  I would say almost instantly that the policy of Xi Jinping in particular—in other word since December 2012—remind u of the Sovietization and Russianization policy of Stalin , who of course move the Tatars from Crimea , for example , to about three other place throughout the then Soviet Union .  I would like to go back to something that be say earlier .  China be obviously try very hard to make sure the international community be not necessarily see what 's happen .
***** The question be , will the House , on reconsideration , pass the bill , the objection [ [ Page H1504 ] ] of the President to the contrary notwithstanding ? .  This year , for the first time in 3 year , the Congress pass an intelligence authorization act and present it to the President .  In recent year , while the bill pass the House , it never even get to conference .  It be n't easy , but I think it be crucial that we revitalize the oversight process , and I commit to get an authorization bill not only pass through the House but send to the President .  Intelligence funding be one of the few area where the law require fund to be both appropriate and authorize .  My colleague on the other side of the aisle be find out how tough it be to pass legislation in the intelligence area .  Again , this be a bill that pass the Senate overwhelmingly , clearly support by a majority of this House .  The manual specifically prohibit eight interrogation technique , include waterboarding .  By extend the field manual to the intelligence community , the legislation would effectively outlaw waterboarding and similar coercive technique .
***** And again , I thank you all for your observation and I can assure you that we be go to continue to try and improve in America and help all the state within the OSCE in their free and fair election .  In the past I have say , “ before they first put on a badge , a police officer take an oath to uphold the law .  The Justice in Policing Act legislation include my ERRPA and LETIA legislation , which have pass the House but have stall in the Senate .  I have be proud to work with my House and Senate colleague on this and other legislation that require enhance profile data collection for our Justice Department ; condition State and local law enforcement fund on combat profiling , and require performance-based standard to ensure that instance of misconduct will be minimize through training and oversight .  The bill ban choke hold by federal authority and condition federal law enforcement fund for State and local government on the adoption of choke hold ban .  This mean limit the transfer of military-grade equipment to State and local law enforcement and require Federal uniformed police officer to wear body camera .  I welcome today ’ s event a an opportunity to consider these and other practice that can improve law enforcement and it relation with our community .  If a law or practice violate OSCE human right and democracy norm before the pandemic , circumstance now will surely not cure that violation .  Unfortunately , just this virus exploit vulnerability of pre-existing condition , some government may exploit the human right limitation already in place before this pandemic , include law or practice that unduly restrict civil society , or limit the freedom of expression , association , or assembly .  Finally , democratic institution , include a the rule of law , the independence of the judiciary , and free election , must be preserve even during state of emergency .
***** Here be a few example of what 's go on - very incomplete , since keep up with the news would be a full-time What can you do ? .  Could a `` little old lady in Switzerland `` who send a check to an orphanage be take into custody if , unbeknownst to her , some of her donation be pass to Al Qaeda terrorist ? .  Leon ask if a detention would be illegal if it be base solely on evidence gather by torture , because `` torture be illegal .  ( i ) the United States initiate the arrest of Abu Ali in Saudi Arabia ; ( ii ) the United States have interrogate Abu Ali in the Saudi prison ; ( iii ) the United States be control his detention in Saudi Arabia ; ( iv ) the United States be keep Abu Ali in Saudi Arabia to avoid constitutional scrutiny by United States court ; ( v ) Saudi Arabia would immediately release Abu Ali to United States official upon a request by the United States government ; and ( vi ) Abu Ali have be subject to torture while in the Saudi prison .  `` He be a person of security interest , but we do not have any law under which he can be charge .  government believe he 's do something wrong , they would n't let him go , `` he say .  Lawyers for some of the people implicate in the various report say the Graner trial would make it hard to prosecute their client .  Because it purportedly involve a plot against the President , because it involve many of the issue leave unresolved by the early terror law case , and because the defendant be the valedictorian of his religious school class in Virginia , the Abu Ali case shape up to be not just one of the more interesting case since the terror attack on America , but also one of the most important .  And , remember , the government initially let all of u believe that Hamdi be too dangerous to be either try or release - until the fed pawn him off on the Saudis , who promptly let him go .
***** I have be accuse on more than one occasion of try to make possible another 9/11 attack , an especially terrible slur give that thousand of my neighbor die in the World Trade Center on that day in my district .  The United States historically have be a leader in the effort to establish and enforce the law of war and convention against torture .  It be unforgivable that some civilian here in Washington seem to think that they know good , and that they need to be more brutal than our military and professional interrogator be , and that they have permission to break our law and to break treaty that we have sign , and to try to keep it secret , because the American people and the Congress can not be trust with know what these people know and can not be trust with judge what these people have do in our name .  Torture be ban by various provision of law , include the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 19 U .  The interrogator eventually reportedly use some version of what be call waterboarding on him for just 90 second , at which point he begin to reveal information that help authority arrest at least six major terrorist , include some who be in the process of plot the bring down of the Brooklyn Bridge , bomb a hotel , blow up U .  The New York Times article itself point out that `` rely on the Supreme Court find that only the conduct that shock the conscience be unconstitutional , a Justice Department legal opinion find that , in some circumstance , not even waterboarding be necessarily cruel , inhuman or degrading .  Now , we do not know whether or not the Department of Justice legal opinion actually use the example of waterboarding , but the general principle express by the Justice Department allude to in the article be that the Supreme Court have find that -- in some circumstance -- certain interrogation method be not necessarily cruel , inhuman or degrading , if , for example , a suspect be believe to possess crucial intelligence about a planned terrorist attack .
***** Five day into Trump ’ s presidency , the congresswoman express her enthusiastic approval when Trump float the possibility of bring back waterboarding a an interrogation technique .  6 would change thing .
***** You could n't make it up however hard you try .  His guilt under the 2001 law that back the International Criminal Court make him officially Britain 's first war criminal .

But though Mr Bush say at the time he wish to close Guantanamo , just three month later he be successful in get Congress to pass new legislation that circumvent the Supreme Court ruling and open the way to proceed with the tribunal .  They be hood and shackle 8 per cent of detainee accuse of fight for a terrorist group 300 prisoner who have be release back to their own country since 2002 86 per cent capture by the Northern Alliance or the Pakistani authority for US bounty 70 prisoner who President Bush 's administration plan to charge in military court 10 prisoner who have already be charge 0 number of detainee bring to trial You could n't make it up if you try .  Putting aside the logistical problem that such a deployment would involve , one thing have to be say in favour of the strategy .
***** The issue of waterboarding front and center last night a ( INAUDIBLE ) .  You say , I would bring back waterboarding and I would bring back a hell of a lot bad than waterboarding .  I say , yes , I would bring back waterboarding .  And I would make it a hell of a lot bad than waterboarding .  I have in mind go bad than waterboarding .

***** Both be base upon the rule of law in the form of the Common Law inherit from England plus a write Constitution and Bill of Rights ( or Bill of Rights and Freedoms , in Canada 's case ) .  The first of these be tradition back up by public opinion and the second be that , in any case , the effect of such a dismissal be to have a General Election where the people make up their mind which side of the particular controversy have sufficient merit to put it proponent ( back ) in charge .  Why would the American people go back to the well that have so poison u yet again .  The consequence of our `` buy now pay later `` attitude have come to pass .  As I grow up there I watch how I mature day-to-day in that mirror a I pass through the kitchen .  These thing would be consistent with the welfare of industry and the welfare of citizen .  This would send a clear message that `` We the People `` be expect real change and reform , and quite quickly I might add .
***** There be a difference , however , in how we would go about this .  In fact , if I can go one step far beyond what you just ask , I think the president of the United States -- and I , a president -- would have a responsibility a we begin to bring our combat troop out of Iraq to prepare for two possibility .  And I would make sure that the entire issue be also tie to stability in the Israeli-Palestinian issue .  You 're go to bring all troop home from Iraq -- if in fact there be no political solution by the time I be president , then I would bring them out , because all they be be fodder .  But you would not make a commitment to have them all out by .  I would make a commitment to have them all out if there be not a political reconciliation , because they 're just fodder .  The president veto the law .  Senator Dodd , be it practical for you a a senator and others who now serve in Congress to go back to Washington and for 40 consecutive day try to cut off the funding for the war .

***** The « war against terrorism » , international law and the growth of unchecked executive power in the U .  The « war against terrorism » , international law and the growth of unchecked executive power in the U .  He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression , for if he violate that duty , he establish a precedent that will reach unto himself .  Thomas Paine [ 1 ] The irreducible core of the rule of law be this .  that those who execute the law must never be the sole and final arbiter of the law .  Franck [ 2 ] 1 Introduction1Since September 11th there have be a profound change not only in Americas attitude toward international relation but also in it domestic approach to civil liberty and the rule of law .  The Bush administration claim the right to initiate military action unilaterally and to wage preventive war , thereby undermine what be leave of the post world war II multilateral regulation model of international conflict and reorient international law upon the paradigm of imperial rule [ 3 ] .  Despite of the latter commitment to extend the significance of democracy and the rule of law to international relation , his exaggerated idealistic internationalism never really match with the profound undercurrent of exceptionalism in American history a the refusal of congress to ratify the provision of adhesion to the League of Nations in the Versailles treaty ( 1919-20 ) exemplify .  One should not take the stance of superiority in criticize this inclination to justify the state of exception , because it be part of the logic of politics even in a democracy that abide by the rule of law .
***** You also have a Republican president at this moment and one of the candidate on stage , Senator McCain , who be behind that big so- call comprehensive immigration reform that would give legal status to 12 million or more illegal immigrant in the United States .  So he want to know what you would do about me and other kid like me -- the unwitting child of illegal -- well , you know .  I would like to know , if you become president of the United States , will you continue to aid and abet the flight of illegal alien into this country ? .  If we do n't allow the child of illegal immigrant to go to school , we would have have 70,000 child on the street at a time in which New York City be go through a massive crime wave , average 2,000 murder a year , 10,000 felony a week .  If we do n't allow illegals to report crime , a lot of criminal would have go free because they 're the one who have the information .  And the idea that they report any illegal alien that commit a crime -- how about the fact that the people who be here illegally have violate the law ? .  We 're not go to give you benefit , other than those require by the law , like health care and education , and that 's the course we 're go to have to pursue .  ( Applause ) Number three , I apply to have our state police enforce the immigration law in May , seven month before I be out of office .
***** In July Mr Mulally say three of Fords North American truck plant would switch to make small car , at least four of which will come from Europe—new version of the Fiesta , Focus , C-Max minivan and Kuga crossover .

And I want to make sure that the provision that emerge meet that test — that we be not in some way sneak in funding for abortion , but , on the other hand , that we 're not restrict woman 's insurance choice , because one of the pledge I make in that same speech be to say that if you 're happy and satisfied with the insurance that you have , that it 's not go to change .  I still hate that `` sneak in funding for abortion `` line .  It 's like the lawmaker hear the cry for affordable premium and comprehensive coverage , and think Yeah , but what about all those unscrupulous whore scheme to use their health care coverage to go to abortion party and make fetus-necklaces ? .  There be no fuck `` common ground `` between people who believe in woman 's right to autonomy over their own body and people who believe that woman 's body be property of the government , or their doctor , or their husband , or anyone else who get a vote on whether they have to be pregnant even if they do n't want to be .

Bart Stupak ( D-MI ) and pa on the House floor shortly before the entire package be vote on -- amount to a massive expansion of abortion restriction .  In an interview last week , Stupak say his amendment amount to no more than current law ; in this interview , DeGette respond to his explanation .  The abortion debate in Congress have come down to a battle between two proposal -- Stupak 's , and one offer by Rep .  The Capps proposal would create an accounting firewall to segregate federal fund from pay for abortion for recipient of federal subsidy who shop for insurance on the regional health insurance exchange create under the bill .  It would also require regional insurance commissioner to try to ensure that each exchange offer one insurance plan that do cover abortion , and one that do not .  The way that I understand the Stupak amendment be that you could buy a plan in the exchange with your own private money that cover elective abortion , but you could n't if you receive subsidy [ Note .  under Stupak , subsidy recipient can buy supplemental abortion-coverage plan with their own money ] , and that the argument against it be that so many people receive subsidy in the exchange that private health insurer just would n't provide them -- but this be not what you 're say .  What the Stupak amendment would say be that they ca n't even apply the $ 90 of premium to buy a health care plan that would cover abortion .

***** After extensive study on the issue over the last 20 year , there appear to be no convincing scientific , medical or public policy rationale to justify the current or any other disparity in penalty for the two form of cocaine .  Scientific and medical research have find that crack and powder cocaine have essentially the same pharmacological and physiological effect on a person .  For these and other reason , the Federal Judicial Conference have recommend on many occasion this Congress eliminate mandatory minimum sentence under all circumstance , and I ca n't think of a more fitting place to start such a process then to do it with the most notorious , unfair mandatory sentence in the Federal system , the crack cocaine penalty .  If this be the case , I think it demand further examination by this Committee and Congress into the difference in which crack and powder cocaine be traffic .  Many also claim that our Federal prison be full of first- time , nonviolent drug offender .  The likelihood of a first-time offender , even a drug offender , be sentence to Federal prison , not simple jail or probation , be pretty slim .

And so I think we have a great opportunity not to talk about how we get here , but this darn thing be n't work .  And we spend a lot of time in our Federal enforcement work on marijuana law rather than crack and cocaine and meth and heroin .  I would suggest that we should do thing to discourage people from use cigarette as well a marijuana .  If you be a kid on the street smoking marijuana and you happen to be a user , you should be deal with a lot differently than someone who be out there sell large amount of marijuana .

***** Like most Americans who follow the debate over marijuana legalization in this country , I be disappoint that the U .  Drug Enforcement Administration this week once again determine that marijuana have no medical use and leave it in Schedule I of the federal Controlled Substances Act .  NORML first petition the DEA to reschedule marijuana to a low schedule back in 1973 , and we have be involve in two subsequent attempt to accomplish the same result , without success .  So they will continue to oppose any step to loosen control over marijuana until Congress force them to change .  The initial petition NORML file to reschedule marijuana in 1973 end up be an endurance test .  The agency refuse to even acknowledge our petition or respond to it until we go to the court of appeal and force them to respond .  By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely use within a supervised routine of medical care .  And twice in the intervening decade NORML have be a party to subsequent attempt to require the DEA to reschedule marijuana ; and both time , a they do in this most recent case , the DEA continue to insist that marijuana have no medical usefulness and should remain on Schedule I , along with heroin .  When the federal Controlled Substances Act be be consider by Congress in 1970 — after the prior federal anti-marijuana act have be hold unconstitutional — various member of Congress debate the question of where to place marijuana under the new act .  A separate provision of that new law establish The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse ( aka the Marijuana Commission ) , which be charge with the responsibility of determine the appropriate policy regard marijuana and report back to Congress .  ) , would require that marijuana be reschedule and would prohibit federal official from interfere in state-compliant activity specific to the physician-authorized use or distribution of medical cannabis .  If the US government hold patent on cannabis ( several , actually ) , establish medical efficacy for a number of ailment , would this not be document evidence that their decision contradict their own action and research , as well a the scheduling , and therefore should be reschedule ? .

Specifically , the plan call for reschedule the marijuana plant under the Controlled Substances Act — a move the campaign insists will lead toward it eventual `` decriminalization .  ADVERTISEMENTWhile current federal law categorizes and regulate marijuana like heroin ( both be categorize a Schedule I control substance ) , reschedule the plant to a Schedule II drug ( like cocaine or oxycodone ) — a the candidate propose on his website — or even a Schedule III drug ( like anabolic steroid ) be similarly inappropriate .  Further , the federal policy in place that stifle researcher 's ability to clinically study cannabis — such a the requirement that all source material be purchase from the University of Mississippi 's federally license marijuana cultivation program — be regulatory requirement that be specific to marijuana , not to other Schedule I substance .  In addition , the campaign ’ s call for marijuana decriminalization be only half a loaf .  Decriminalization , a policy that replace criminal penalty for low-level possession offense with civil sanction , keep the illicit marijuana marketplace intact .

That may come a a surprise , since the White House have deny the linkage indignantly and , in my opinion , quite foolishly , in recent week , ever since Republican critic of the administration ’ s diplomacy toward Tehran denounce the payment a ransom .  But it should not come a a shock , nor should it discredit the administration ’ s approach to Iran , since the use of financial leverage to persuade Tehran to curtail it most dangerous policy have constitute a core element of U .  policy arsenal for deal with Iran for four decade , both side should be contemplate the deep issue with Washington ’ s readiness to use cash to induce more constructive Iranian behavior .

Just like the current child tax credit , Romney ’ s proposal would phase out for wealthy parent — the benefit begin phase out for single filer with $ 200,000 and joint filer with $ 400,000 in annual income .

***** The ACA low the number of uninsured Americans and improved access to care for those who gain coverage The ACA low the number of uninsured Americans and improved access to care for those who gain coverage Abstract Issue .  The Affordable Care Act ’ s ( ACA ) coverage provision have extend health insurance coverage to million of Americans .  While the effect of the Medicaid expansion and marketplace establishment on coverage have be well study , the result effect of coverage on access to health care remain unclear .  To examine how the 2014 coverage expansion affect health care access follow the first open enrollment period of October 2013 to March 2014 .  We find that gain insurance coverage through the expansion decrease the probability of not receive medical care by between 20 .  Gaining insurance coverage also increase the probability of have a usual place of care by between 47 .  These find suggest that not only have the ACA decrease the number of uninsured Americans , but have substantially improve access to care for those who gain coverage .  Background One of the main goal of health reform like the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) be to expand insurance coverage and , ultimately , to increase access to care .  To put this figure in context , prior to implementation of the insurance expansion , about 47 percent of uninsured people report that they be unable to access care because of cost .  10 Since it passage , others have argue that the insurance coverage provide to people under the ACA provide insufficient protection against high cost or offer such limited network that the newly insure can not find care .
***** 8 fact that explain what ’ s wrong with American health care 1 ) Americans pay way , way , way more for health care than anyone else Health care in the United States be expensive .  8 trillion on health care annually .  America 's government spend more , a a percentage of the economy , on public health care than Canada , the United Kingdom , Japan , or Australia .  It spend even more than that on private health care .  The reason we spend so much money be n't because we go to the doctor a ton .  On average , Americans actually see the doctor less than people in other country .  The reason American health care be expensive be because when we go to the doctor , it cost more than when , say , someone in Canada go to the doctor .  Part of this be about the price per unit of health care in the United States .  Harvard University 's David Cutler point out that we have much high administrative cost than most other country — and those cost get tack onto the bill when we go to the doctor .  Lastly , American hospital tend to throw more technology at health problem — a heart attack , for example , be treat with more scan and test in America than elsewhere , and that also drive up the price of go to the doctor in the United States .  Though ultimately economist believe that the money employer spend on health benefit come from the money they would have spend on wage , worker do n't feel the direct cost of their health insurance choice , so they have little reason to try to keep spending low .
***** We also have a few folk who work so hard on behalf of the people of Maryland every single day .  Now , I know that a lot of you have see some of the antic go on in Congress right now .  So I want to take a little bit of time today to speak with you -- the people who send u to serve -- about something that be critical to our family , critical to our business , critical to our economy .  And that be the reform that we be make to our health care system .  But there be few thing more fundamental to the economic security of the middle class and everybody whos try to get into the middle class than health care .  For a long time , America be the only advanced economy in the world where health care be not a right , but a privilege .  We leave ten of million of Americans without the security of health insurance .  About one in 10 Americans who get their health care through their employer lose that coverage .  So the health care system be not work .  And the rise cost of health care burden business and become the big driver of our long-term deficit .  Everywhere I go a I run for President back in 2007 , 2008 , everyplace Ive go a President , I would hear story from folk just like you of insurer that deny a child coverage because he have a preexisting condition like asthma ; of cancer survivor that have to choose between their home or their health care ; of small business who want to do the right thing by their employee but have see their insurance premium go up so high that they just couldnt do it anymore .  But we be fortunate enough to have good health insurance .  Because of the Affordable Care Act , insurance company can no longer put lifetime limit on the care your family need , or discriminate against child with preexist condition .  The major reason why people dont have health insurance be either they dont have a job , or they do have a job but their employer doesnt offer health insurance , or theyre self-employed .  Good health insurance for the price of your cellphone bill , or less .  If you get health insurance , youre get good protection , good benefit .  So if theyre treat somebody who doesnt have health insurance , they jack up premium for everybody who do have health insurance .  They say that violate people liberty , tell them theyve get to get health insurance .  Its unfair for responsible employer who be do the right thing , give their employee health insurance , to get undercut by some operator thats not provide health insurance for their employee .

***** These be change that will require bi-partisan cooperation something that be rare in health policy .  The change be need because there be at least six major problem that aren ’ t go away .  An Impossible Mandate The slowdown in the rate of increase in health care spending over the past decade be welcome news , but no one be predict that health care spending will not exceed the growth of income in future year .  In fact , for the past 40 year real , per caput health care spending have be grow at twice the rate of growth of real , per capita income .  Health care spending will take more and more of the family budget ; it will take an ever large share of worker ' gross pay .  In short , the health reform law be try to force u to remain on an unsustainable path .  This mean that a health care cost become more and more of a burden for the average family , they will get less and less help from government through time .  make the tax subsidy for health insurance the same regardless of where people get their health insurance .

As the AMA have previously state , member of Congress must keep top of mind the potentially life-altering impact their policy decision will have .  We believe that any change to the ACA must be guide by ensure that we continue to provide health care coverage for the ten of million of Americans who have benefit from the law .

***** Increased health care cost share work a intend .  It burden patient who need care the most .  be Building Worker Power Increased health care cost share work a intend .  It burden patient who need care the most A number of different health care policy proposal that have emerge in recent year share a common goal .  make household directly pay for a large share of most health expenditure by encourage high deductible , high copays , or high co-insurance rate .  The rationale of such proposal be that too-generous insurance policy ( either those provide by employer or public insurance such a Medicare ) distort the price consumer face , and that remove this distortion would allow patient to choose their health care more wisely , hence slow health care cost growth .  The “ success ” of increase cost share hinge on the ability of patient to make educated decision about their health care purchase much like they do when buy other good and service such a milk , car , or cell phone plan .  This brief argue that this be a flawed strategy for health care cost containment .  The health care market be unlike other market ; thus , force increase cost share on American household be a deeply inefficient strategy for try to contain health care cost .  Forcing Americans to pay a high share of health cost will not induce them to shop around and compare price when they be experience chest pain or their child be suffer from an asthma attack .  Further , consumer of health care be in no position to second-guess their doctor when she tell them an MRI be good than an X-ray ( and hence worth the high price ) to diagnose a condition .  The theory behind this idea be that people will become more careful consumer of health care and will forgo unnecessary care that they only consume because insurance reduce it cost to them , all of which will bring down overall health cost .  Shifting health insurance cost onto worker , senior , and their family may hamper their ability to maintain and secure affordable health care .  , face a high share of total health spending ) they will become more careful consumer of health care and will forgo unneeded care only previously purchase because they be not face it full cost .  Nyman ( 2007 ) directly question this theory by argue that a large portion of moral hazard represent health care that sick consumer would not otherwise have access to without the income that it transfer to them through insurance .  With health insurance , she can afford both .

Among all the right to which we be entitle , health care may be the most intersectional and crucial .  Universal health care be crucial to the ability of the most marginalized segment of any population to live life of dignity .  Without our health we—literally—do not live , let alone live with dignity .  In the United States , we can not enjoy the right to health care .

That committee codify our human right , include , at Article 25 , the essential right to health .

And the bad part of these story be that they be enrol in insurance but could not get need health care .  Fees actually inhibit the responsible use of health care by put up barrier to access care .  Because our “ system ” be base on insurance rather than health , our Supreme Court be able to successfully void the right to health in it Burwell decision .  The bad part of this “ non-health system ” be that our life depend on the ability to access health care , not health insurance .

But now , with Democrats hold unify control of Washington , the first piece of major legislation likely to land on President Joe Bidens desk be set to hand the industry billion while do little to control price or address other stumble block that prevent people from access health care .  The new COVID-19 relief package , which Senate Democrats be widely expect to pass within the week , would expand Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) subsidy for two year and provide funding to underwrite coverage through COBRA , the program that offer temporary extension of employer health insurance for worker who lose their job .

The relatively moderate reform come a an alliance between big health care company and business interest join force with Democratic leadership , which have largely focus on shore up private health insurance by bail out employer health plan and expand the ACA .  The outcome be a relief to the health care industry .  At a moment when some lobbyist be worry that the effect of the pandemiccombined with Democratic control in Congresswould give progressive traction to push for Medicare for All or a public health insurance option , the current relief bill do neither .  And we can close the coverage gap that continue to exist use that framework without some sort of more fundamental change to how people in this country get their health care coverage , say Molly Smith , group vice president for public policy at the American Hospital Association .

ObamaCare have hamper medical innovation by tax the very people who build medical device here in America and be cause them to move those business offshore or simply cut down their hiring .  It be no wonder the labor participation rate -- the number of people who be actually in the workforce -- be at a 35-year low .  As I stand here today , the broken promise of ObamaCare be cause enormous distress and financial hardship for people all across my State of Texas and all across America .  In other word , ObamaCare be make it significantly hard for many Americans to pay their bill , to buy grocery , and take care of their family .  So if you be the President try to sell this so-called Affordable Care Act , you would n't want to scare that 90 percent of people into think they ca n't keep what they have even though they like it .  If we have focus on those people who either do not have coverage or who have inadequate coverage -- obviously a small subset of Americans than the whole country -- if we focus on them and deal with their challenge in purchase health insurance , we could have do much well .  There be million more who have low-quality Medicaid coverage that many doctor refuse to accept because , in my State , Medicaid pay a doctor about 50 cent on the dollar compare to private insurance .  If we ask most people the big problem they have with their health insurance , they say it cost too much , and we have make it bad .  I know that do n't sound like a panacea , but most States have captive insurance market and many State legislature , include the Texas legislature , have mandate coverage that many people simply do n't want , but it add to the cost of their health insurance .  If I like the insurance coverage of Wisconsin or Louisiana or somewhere else , and if that suit my need , I could buy it there and we would have a true competitive market and people would compete base on quality and price , but we do n't have that now .  So the temptation be to do everything and to run up the cost of health care coverage .  But we already have in place high-risk pool in the States , and if we need to help those States provide coverage to people with those high-risk health condition , we could have do it a whole lot cheap and a whole lot more efficiently than create this huge monstrosity , this huge bureaucracy , this huge expense know a ObamaCare .  The Web site where people be suppose to go to buy that insurance have be plague with problem that everyone in the country seem to know about , and that have cause huge amount of anxiety .  a consumer dig into the detail , they be find that the deductible and other out-of-pocket cost be often much high than what be typical in employer-sponsored health plan -- the plan many of these people have have in the past .  So what we be see be not just the high cost , not just the high deductible , the high copays ; there be also a lot of confusion about the health care Web site itself , and I think that be only go to get bad .

***** Politics Govt Search The health-care sector be in many way the most consequential part of the United States economy .  It be a fundamental part of people ’ s life , support their health and well-being .  [ 1 ] Health insurance be the large component ( 26 percent ) of nonwage compensation ( BLS 2019b ) and health care be one of the large category of consumer spending ( 8 .  health care be substantial .  The United States spend more than other country without obtain good health outcome ( Papanicolas , Woskie , and Jha 2018 ) .  Health care be grow a a share of the economy and government budget in way that appear unsustainable ( CMS 1960 .  This growth have slow at time ; health spending a a share of GDP be roughly flat in much of the 1990s , and growth have also slow to some extent in recent year .  Sixty year ago , health care be 5 percent of the U .  As a country get rich , spend a high share of income on health may be optimal ( Hall and Jones 2007 ) .  [ 2 ] Countries with a high level of output per caput tend to have a high level of health expenditure per caput ( Sawyer and Cox 2018 ) .  In addition , a the population age , health deteriorates and health-care spending naturally rise .  The United States have a health-care system that largely consist of private provider and private insurance , but a health care have become a large part of the economy , a high share of health-care funding have be provide by government ( figure B ) .  Of course , health cost be also bear by the private sector .  But understand why health care have have little productivity growth relative to the rest of the economy be important ( Sheiner and Malinovskaya 2016 ) .  The United States spend much more on health care a a share of the economy ( 17 .  However , public health insurance in the United States cover only 34 percent of the population , much less than the universal coverage in country like Canada and the United Kingdom ( Berchick , Barnett , and Upton 2019 ; OECD 2020b ) , indicate that it cost far more to provide coverage in the U .  [ 11 ] Because prescription drug be an ongoing expense for many , and give the immediate and direct health impact that often result from a lack of access , the cost of prescription drug can dominate health-care cost discussion .  In other cases—such a emergencies—patients be often unable to compare cost or weigh price .  Roughly half of the overall variation be associate with difference in price across region , with the other half due to difference in the quantity of health care consume .  [ 15 ] High price indicate underlie concern that be different than those indicate by high use of health care .  These rent be drive by market imperfection include provider market power and the difficulty that health-care patient and other payer have in assess price and quality ( Chernew , Dafny , and Pany 2020 ) .  Administrative health-care cost be high a a share of GDP in the United States than in other country .  However , these requirement impose cost on patient and provider that must be take into account , and in some case they may simply reflect a battle over who pay for necessary procedure .  Moreover , health insurance can not function a insurance if patient often incur extraordinarily large ( and unexpected ) bill when the need for expensive medical procedure arises , nor can insurers bargain down price on behalf of their beneficiary .
***** 5 , 2019 , honor those who have lose their life due to the high cost of insulin and demand low insulin price .  Americans spend vast sum on health care .  Certainly , health care be expensive all over the world , and it make good sense for rich country to spend large amount to extend their citizen life and to reduce pain and suffering .  Health care can sometimes harm people , through medical mistake , or the overprescription of opioids .  But there be also harm to people life from it extraordinary and unnecessary cost .  The percentage of national income that be absorb by health care have grow over the past half-century , from 5 % in 1960 to 18 % in 2017 , reduce what be available for anything else from 95 % in 1960 to 82 % today .  The cost of health care contribute to the long-term stagnation in wage ; to fewer good job , especially for less educated worker ; and to rise income inequality .  The cost of employer-provided health insurance , largely invisible to employee , not only hold down wage but also destroy job , especially for less skilled worker , and replaces good job with bad job at low wage .  Health care cost directly hurt those without insurance , while those who be insure must pay co-payments , deductible and employee contribution .  These very large number be just the waste of health care .
***** The big problem with health care isn ’ t with insurance or politics .  It ’ s that we ’ re measure the wrong thing the wrong way .  Porter The big problem with health care isnt with insurance or politics .  Its that be measure the wrong thing the wrong way .  The big problem with health care isnt with insurance or politics .  Its that be measure the wrong thing the wrong way .  health care cost currently exceed 17 % of GDP and continue to rise .  Other country spend less of their GDP on health care but have the same increase trend .  Third-party payors ( insurance company and government ) reimburse for procedure perform rather than outcome achieve , and patient bear little responsibility for the cost of the health care service they demand .  But few acknowledge a more fundamental source of escalate cost .  the system by which those cost be measure .  To put it bluntly , there be an almost complete lack of understanding of how much it cost to deliver patient care , much less how those cost compare with the outcome achieve .  Making matter bad , participant in the health care system do not even agree on what they mean by cost .  The Challenges of Health Care Costing Accurate cost measurement in health care be challenge , first because of the complexity of health care delivery itself .  The widespread confusion between what a provider charge , what it be actually reimburse , and it cost be a major barrier to reduce the cost of health care .  But the problem be compound when the reimbursement rate be also use to allocate physician cost to patient , a purpose for which they be never intend .  Many health care system participant , include economist and accountant , believe that most cost in health care be fix because so much care be deliver use share staff , space , and equipment .  If most cost be fix , growth in demand for health care would increase only that small fraction of cost that be variable , lead to low average cost in the system , not the dramatically high share of GDP now be devote to health care .
***** As with other type of insurance be risk among many individual .  By estimate the overall risk of health risk and health system expense over the risk pool , an insurer can develop a routine finance structure , such a a monthly premium or payroll tax , to provide the money to pay for the health care benefit specify in the insurance agreement .  According to the Health Insurance Association of America , health insurance be define a `` coverage that provide for the payment of benefit a a result of sickness or injury .

The type and amount of health care cost that will be cover by the health insurance provider be specify in writing , in a member contract or `` Evidence of Coverage `` booklet for private insurance , or in a national [ health policy ] for public insurance .  , there be two type of health insurance - tax payer-funded and private-funded .  an employer ) pay to the health plan to purchase health coverage .  The amount that the insured must pay out-of-pocket before the health insurer pay it share .  For example , policy-holders might have to pay a $ 7500 deductible per year , before any of their health care be cover by the health insurer .  It may take several doctor 's visit or prescription refill before the insured person reach the deductible and the insurance company start to pay for care .  The amount that the insured person must pay out of pocket before the health insurer pay for a particular visit or service .  There have be criticism that the change will cause many people to drop their private health insurance , cause a further burden on the public hospital system , and a rise in premium for those who stay with the private system .  The government subsidise the premium for all private health insurance cover , include hospital and ancillary ( extra ) , by 10 % , 20 % or 30 % , depend on age .  all people work be require to pay a portion of their income to a not-for-profit health insurance fund , which mutualises the risk of illness , and which reimburse medical expense at vary rate .  Secondly , since 2000 , the government now provide health care to those who be not cover by a mandatory regime ( those who have never work and who be not student , mean the very rich or the very poor ) .

The agreement be sign by nearly 100 other country .  5C temperature threshold in sight , then the step take to limit carbon emission in the next nine year be absolutely critical .
***** ” While the new language shift the exist timeframe for peak emission earlier , it leave the precise year unclear , which open the door for further potential announcement of an enhancement of it 2030 commitment .  China ’ s commitment to go carbon neutral by 2060 be huge progress , but it be 16 year later than the IPCC recommend to fulfill the 1 .  Current target cover a range of time frame ; most country reference specific year between 2030 and 2050 , while others like Singapore and Japan use more general reference to the second half of the century .
***** The conference will be an opportunity to measure the progress make since the signing of the legally bind Paris Agreement in 2015 and to evaluate the state of international cooperation on climate change .  Signatories to the agreement be require to submit NDC update to the UN every five year .  We then examine climate announcement , policy statement and speech by government official over the past year to help “ read between the line ” and gain insight into China ’ s progress and intention regard the four action area .  15 October , President Xi state that China would “ ​​put in place a ‘ 1+N ’ policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality .

In September last year , President Xi announce that China aim to have CO2 emission peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 .  At the summit , President Xi call upon all party to uphold multilateral consensus , focus on concrete action and accelerate green transition , in our united action to tackle climate change and protect the planet , our share home .

But it require frequent meeting between the ratify country , know a the Conference of the Parties , or COP .  The legally bind treaty require develop country to reduce emission by an average of 5 percent below 1990 level and establish a system to monitor country ’ progress .  ” In July 2001 , negotiator in Bonn , Germany , reach breakthrough on green technology , agreement on emission trading , and compromise on how to account for carbon sink ( natural reservoirs that take in more carbon than they release ) .  Washington eventually back down , and the party adopt the Bali Action Plan , which establish the goal of draft a new climate agreement by 2009 .
***** China release it first national climate change plan this year , compose of measure be take across the economy that may help slow Chinas greenhouse gas emission growth .  Yet , China face substantial challenge in mitigate it increase contribution to global greenhouse gas emission , which will require a much high level of effort than what may be achieve by measure already in place .  Although official data for 2006 be not yet available , estimate show that emission from energy use be up 9 percent from the previous year , which would make China the large emitter on an annual basis , surpass U .  emission that year by 8 percent .  Chinas increase in energy-related emission in the past few year have be drive primarily by industrial energy use , fuel by an increased percentage of coal in the overall fuel mix .  Changing Chinas emission trajectory will require either a substantial shift away from coal or massive investment in capture the CO2 emission from coal-based energy source .

The agreement come at a time when awareness of the risk of climate change have never be high , thanks to the sober accretion of extreme weather event around the world .  Which be why virtually everyone in the climate world be stun when the agreement be announce on November 12th .  I make the case that if the deal be do well , and it have enough ambition , it could help to build momentum for Paris next year , recall Stern .  The last major round of international climate negotiation in Copenhagen in 2009 have be a festival of conspiracy and betrayal , end with an 11th-hour , closed-door confrontation between rich and poor nation that only deepen the cynicism among many that the world would ever strike an agreement to cut carbon pollution .  A year from now , the world be set to meet in Paris for another summit .  While carbon restriction that dont go into effect for 16 year in the future may not sound significant , for a country a big and fast-growing a China , such a promise translate into huge reduction over time .  team know it would be open to the charge that we be give China license to increase it carbon pollution for 16 year , while make costly promise to double our own reduction in the same period .
***** [ 2 ] There be now a considerable literature on China ’ s prospect for meeting that goal , with many analyst project that China be likely to achieve peak emission several year at least before 2030 .  An influential 2015 paper project that 900 GW of new renewable and nuclear capacity ( almost equal to the entire power generate capacity of the United States ) would be require to meet this goal .  In July 2019 , Premier Li Keqiang announce that China have meet this goal ( 11 year ahead of schedule ) .  do the new climate deal let China do nothing for 16 year ? .

MOSTLY FALSE The battle between two South Florida congressional candidate -- Republican Adam Hasner and Democrat Lois Frankel -- be largely about who be on the side of the middle class .  She try to portray Hasner a the pal of the rich and say in her ad that he `` be never on our side .  That message be counter to the image he have emphasize of understand the struggle of the middle class .  He say his public school teacher parent in Brooklyn only have $ 31 to their name when Hasner be bear , and he vow to help small business and tell the Miami Herald 's editorial board that his own home be `` severely under water .  `` Hasner give the wealthy tax break worth $ 250,000 a year but hike middle class tax $ 2,000 .  We want to check to see if Frankel accurately characterize Hasner 's record on federal tax .  The Ryan and Romney tax plan When we ask the Frankel campaign for evidence of it claim , they point u to Hasner 's stated support for a budget plan write by U .  Ryan 's plan do n't explicitly call for tax increase .  Instead , it say that overall tax rate should be low -- Ryan suggests two new tax bracket 10 and 25 percent -- while eliminate loophole , deduction and exemption .  But at least two study have suggest that the middle class would see tax increase if the most common tax break be eliminate , even if their overall tax rate drop .  ( That 's different than Frankel , who have repeatedly say like Obama she want to get rid of tax cut for those earn above $ 250,000 .  Our rule Frankel 's ad say `` Hasner give the wealthy tax break worth $ 250,000 a year but hike middle class tax $ 2,000 .  The plan address many aspect of the federal government , include simplifing the tax code by repeal exemption and cut tax rate .  But the impact of Ryan 's plan for the middle class be muddle .  It 's not clear that it would result in a tax hike for the middle class , though some say it will .  The tax plan lack specific , which make it difficult to evaluate .  Hasner say he wo n't vote for a tax plan that include middle-income tax increase .

About two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are children, but they account for one-third of the programs cost, while one-third are elderly, and they account for two-thirds of the cost.
***** 17 References149 Citing ArticlesRelated ArticlesAbstract BackgroundIn the United States , the elderly account for over one third of health care spending .  MethodsWe use data from the Medicare program to estimate lifetime Medicare expense for a sample of 129,166 beneficiary , 65 or old , who die in 1989 and 1990 , accord to age at death .  ( Nursing home cost represent about 20 percent of total health care spending for the elderly and increase with age .  Total Medicare payment will be more substantially affect by the expected increase in the absolute number of elderly people .  IntroductionIn the United States , the elderly account for over one third of health care spending .  Almost two third of their health care be pay for by Medicare — the large single source of health spending in the United States — and Medicaid,1 and a considerable proportion of these cost be incur in the last year of life .  4-6 To quantify the cost of increased longevity , we use Medicare data to compare the payment make for people who die at advanced age with those make for people who die young .
***** It also wasnt easy give the rapid growth of Medicaid cost .  While my legislature be willing to give Medicaid more than it share of it growth revenue over the past six year , it be unwilling to take money away from other need program or to raise tax to pay for double digit annual increase in the cost of provide service our Medicaid program have promise to our people .  So while I be here today to discuss the burden of long-term care cost to the Medicaid program , I want to make an urgent plea for some short-term relief .  Traditionally , state take care of the poor and the federal government take care of the need of the elderly .  And because the cost of care for this group be so great , it be crowd out our ability to care for our traditional state mandate .  Today old and disabled beneficiary account for roughly one-third of Medicaid beneficiary and more than two-thirds of Medicaid expenditure .  While these dually eligibles represent only 17 percent of total Medicaid beneficiary , they account for approximately 35 percent of Medicaid expenditure .  As a result , a number of service and supply for homebound elderly be no longer cover by Medicare .
***** As in the case of adult beneficiary , a child ’ s impairment must be expect to last 12 month or long .  People qualify for benefit under a special income standard must have resource that do not exceed the state ’ s Medicaid eligibility limit and must pay a portion of the cost of service in accordance with state-established rule .  Despite the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to additional subpopulation of people with disability over the past 30 year , it be important to point out that million of Americans with disability do not qualify for benefit furnish through the Medicaid program , because of either a nonqualifying disability or excess income and/or resource .  [ vii ] Covered Services The Medicaid program serf beneficiary with diverse health and social support need , include child and adult with severe , chronic disability .  5 million beneficiary , be also eligible to receive Medicare benefit .  Although SSDI beneficiary have to meet the same disability test a SSI recipient , they also must meet SSI financial eligibility criterion or qualify for Medicaid benefit through an alternative pathway .  As show in chart 2-B , compare to nonelderly adult beneficiary with disability , a significantly large proportion of SSI-eligible child qualify on the basis of a mental or intellectual disability .

***** How much do Medicaid cost and how be fund spend ? .  The federal government match state spending for eligible beneficiary and qualify service without a limit .  The federal share for traditional Medicaid ( include spend for child , parent and non-ACA expansion adult , elderly and people with disability ) be determine by a formula set in statute that be base on a state ’ s per capita income relative to other state .  The formula be design so that the federal government pay a large share of program cost in poor state .  In 2019 , the federal government pay 64 percent of total Medicaid cost with the state pay 36 percent .  , elderly with high medical expense ) .  In general , cost incur by state in administer the Medicaid program be match by the federal government at a 50 percent rate .
***** the demand for LTSS be likely to increase dramatically ; LTSS be a major part of the Medicaid program , account for about a third of total expenditure , and Medicaid be the dominant payer of LTSS .  Second , LTSS be a major part of the Medicaid program , account for about a third of total expenditure , although the percentage have be decline steadily over time .  Although the number of Medicaid beneficiary who be young people with disability have grow substantially over time , the number of elderly Medicaid beneficiary have barely increase since the early 1990s , despite the growth in the number of old people in the general population .  Because people use LTSS have high medical need and because many young people with disability do not qualify for Medicare , user of LTSS account for 42 percent of total Medicaid medical and LTSS expenditures ; old people and young person with disability account for 56 percent of expenditure .  7 million in 2014 to over 380 million people , with the elderly population increase from 48 million to slightly more than 83 million people ( Colby & Ortman , 2015 ) .  Disability be highly relate to age , so the projected growth in the elderly population suggest a large increase in the need for LTSS .  9 year and incur $ 138,000 in LTSS cost ( Favreault & Dey , 2016 ) .  Low and unchanging Medicaid asset level be the probable reason why the number of elderly beneficiary do not increase more in that time period .

While abortion policy have be a hotly contest issue in most presidential election , the Hyde Amendment be not the focus of these debate until the 2016 election .  2 While the president may have a position oppose the Hyde Amendment , any change to the policy would require approval by Congress .  This brief detail the federal program that be affect by the Hyde Amendment and law and regulation that have a similar goal , provide estimate on the share of woman insure by Medicaid affect by the law , review the impact of the law on their access to abortion service , and discuss the potential effect if the law be to be repeal .  Initially , the Hyde Amendment only affect fund for abortion under Medicaid , a state and federal health program for low-income individual .

We find that sexual abuse and financial scandal locate in the Catholic Church contribute to increase exit rate not just in that Church but also , by way of spillover effect , to high exit rate of Protestant Church member .  Introduction In Germany , the annual exit rate of member from the Catholic Church have be increase for decade .  ” Recent shock like the public disclosure of abuse scandal might have drive exit rate .  While we be particularly interested in the effect the abuse and financial scandal have on exit rate , we also try to investigate these shock in comparison to other event happen in the Catholic Church , such a the election of Popes or the announcement of encyclical such a Humanae Vitae .  Moreover , we also take into consideration political event like the fall of the Berlin Wall and the introduction of the solidarity tax or change in the German tax system for reason to be explain below .  Further , we also analyze whether these shock have spillover effect to the Protestant Church , result in high Protestant exit rate a a response to the shock occur in the Catholic Church .  Using county-level data from Prussia in the late 19th century , Becker and Woessmann ( 2009 ) find that Protestantism during that time be associate with high rate of literacy ( with similar find for Switzerland ; Boppart , Falkinger , and Grossmann 2014 ) .

As we focus on exogenous shock in our analysis , we restrict our review of the literature to two aspect of the economics of religion—the determinant of church attendance and of church membership , with the former show a far great decline than the latter in both Catholic and Protestant denomination .

If your church doesnt have a great online experience , no worry , about a million others do .  You can access almost any church you want , anywhere , anytime .  Why attend church ? .

Otherwise know a “ Star Wars , ” SDI seek to create a space-based shield that would render nuclear missile obsolete .

The early chapter present case study of nine instance of regional military intervention undertake by the two country since 1991 , and one analogous case study from the late Cold War eraof American peacekeeping in Lebanon in 19821984 .  For the United States , in addition to the intervention in Lebanon , these case study cover the former Yugoslavia , Panama , Haiti , and Africa , as well a a cross-cutting look at how the Bush administration approach it intervention and force employment decisionmaking .  It be unclear whether this further delay be the result of last-minute doubt on President Yeltsin 's part about use Russian troop to suppress a domestic conflict ( the sort of doubt that have lead him to repeal an early ( October 1991 ) decree deploy troop in Chechnya ) or whether it be the result of last-minute change that Yeltsin be persuade to make in response to the objection of Kremlin enemy of Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai , who have almost certainly draw up the original decree and may well have incorporate both a large role for himself than his enemy wish him to have , and a more evenhanded approach to the conflict than his generally anti-Ingushetian enemy desire .  When federal force do finally deploy , they take up position on the border between North Ossetia and Ingushetia .  The perceived illegitimacy of Russia 's claim notwithstanding , prior to the early 1990s there be no serious conflict in Russian-Chechen relation follow the return of Chechens to their homeland and the restoration of a Chechno-Ingush autonomous republic in 1957 .  Belated attempt on the part of the Russian leadership to counter these action and to obstruct the NCCP 's development and legitimization be futile .  Moreover , give that the election take place under condition of a `` state of emergency , `` the NCCP be in an advantageous position .  Among other point , it draw the attention of the leadership to the necessity for clearly define it position toward those legitimate local authority that remain loyal to the Russian Federation in the Nadterechny region .
