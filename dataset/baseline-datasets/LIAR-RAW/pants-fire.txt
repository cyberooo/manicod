These drop aren ’ t inevitable — national crisis can cause people to rally around the president , a they do after Reagan be shot — but they ’ re the general rule .  So if Trump ’ s approval number be middling-to-poor now , they ’ re likely to get bad soon .

***** Ensuring Access to Affordable Health Care Coverage for Lower Income Cancer Patients and Survivors Introduction Medicaid play a vital role in provide affordable health care coverage to lower income cancer patient and survivor .  Following enactment of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , expansion of state Medicaid program ensure that more cancer patient and survivor would have access to critical treatment and survivorship care .  More than two million Americans ( child and adult under age 65 ) with a history of cancer rely on Medicaid for their health care .  1 The structure of Medicaid and the flexibility state have to alter their program , through the Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver process ( under the Social Security Act ) , provide unique opportunity for state to try novel approach to care through the use of demonstration waiver .  Unfortunately , a number of the waiver be propose by state also have the potential to limit care .  In order to fully understand the importance of Medicaid to cancer patient and survivor , this paper provide an overview of the basic structure of the program .  It also examine the potential impact of the policy proposal currently under discussion at both the state and federal level on cancer patient , survivor and those at risk for cancer .  The Nuts and Bolts of Medicaid Eligibility Medicaid be a health care program administer by each state under broad federal guideline .  It provide comprehensive and affordable health coverage to nearly 65 million low- and modest-income Americans .  For individual to qualify for each of those program , family income need to be very low , in most state a fraction of the federal poverty level ( FPL ) .  The coverage expansion initially focus on pregnant woman and infant in family , later expand to cover low-and modest-income child ; 5 work family ; additional low-income elderly individual ; disable individual with job ; and people in need of long-term care service and support .
***** “ Before people even reach retirement age , big insurance company could be allow to charge them an age tax that add up to thousand of dollar more per year .  Older Americans need affordable health care service and prescription .  “ Finally , Medicaid cut could impact people of all age and put at risk the health and safety of 17 .  Although no one believe the current health care system be perfect , this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable .  The replacement bill , a write , would reverse the coverage gain achieve under the ACA , cause many Americans to lose the health care coverage they have come to depend upon .  The rating and analytics firm S & P Global Ratings have already estimate that as many a 10 million Americans could lose coverage if this bill become law , say that between 2 million and 4 million people could lose the insurance they purchase in the individual health exchange under the ACA , and between 4 million and 6 million could lose their coverage under Medicaid .  We all know that our health system be highly complex , but our core commitment to the patient most in need should be straightforward .  We believe that any change to the ACA must be guide by ensure that we continue to provide health care coverage for the ten of million of Americans who have benefit from the law .  We be please that so many in Congress also recognize the need to preserve patient coverage .  We believe the legislation need to be review through this lens , and carefully evaluate regard it impact on both individual and the ability of hospital and health system which be the backbone of the nation 's health care safety net in term of our ability to care for all of those who walk through our door .  However , these protection be hollow if patient and survivor can ’ t afford insurance that cover the health care service they need to treat their cancer diagnosis .
***** Several Congressional Budget Office report say that overall these provision reduce the budget deficit , that repeal ACA would increase the deficit,89 and that the law reduce income inequality by tax primarily the top 1 % to fund roughly $ 600 in benefit on average to family in the bottom 40 % of the income distribution .  10 The act largely retain the exist structure of Medicare , Medicaid and the employer market , but individual market be radically overhaul .  111 Insurers be make to accept all applicant without charge base on preexist condition or demographic status ( except age ) .  To combat the resultant adverse selection , the act mandate that individual buy insurance ( or pay a fine/tax ) and that insurer cover a list of `` essential health benefit `` .  Polls initially find that a plurality of Americans oppose the act , although it individual provision be generally more popular .  3 Accountable care organization 1 .  ACA amend the Public Health Service Act of 1944 and insert new provision on affordable care into Title 42 of the United States Code .  2 Some regulation apply to the employer market , and the law also make delivery system change that affect most of the health care system .  A partial community rating allow premium to vary only by age and location , regardless of preexist condition .  The National Academy of Medicine define the law 's `` essential health benefit `` a `` ambulatory patient service ; emergency service ; hospitalization ; maternity and newborn care ; mental health and substance use disorder service , include behavioral health treatment ; prescription drug ; rehabilitative and habilitative service and device ; laboratory service ; preventive and wellness service and chronic disease management ; and pediatric service , include oral and vision care `` 2425 and others26 rat Level A or B27 by the U .  30 Preventive care and screen for woman .

In the 2012 election, there were more votes cast than registered voters in St. Lucie County, and Palm Beach County had 141 percent turnout.
***** By and large November 6 go relatively smoothly and more than 120 million ( and count ) register voter be able to cast their ballot in the 2012 election .  What cause the line really vary from state to state , county to county and even poll place to poll place .  In many situation it be simply an overwhelming number of voter .  voter report be ask by poll worker to show their ID in order to cast a ballot .  California law do not require a photo ID to vote .  There be report in Texas that voter be be ask for photo ID in order to cast their ballot although the state ’ s voter photo ID law be not in effect on Tuesday and be currently in the court system .  SandyStates affect by Superstorm Sandy spend the day lead up to Election Day scramble to come up with alternative plan so that voter could cast their ballot .
***** So now that all the data have be report from county , I want to look back at some assumption , and compare them to the actual voting data .  I have no use or interest in play the what if question around third-party vote , so the data in here be just the two-party vote .  I compile this data over the entire month of November , often by pester county to provide data they dont have on their website .  Some of the data come before the final , final certify version , so there might be exceptionally slight variance — like ten of vote in a county — from the state final count .  When I talk about early voting , that be both in-person and vote by mail combine , unless I specify otherwise .  For the sake of interpret the data , everything that wasnt an in-person or traditional vote by mail ballot be allocate to Election Day .  We know how people vote on Election Day , but we do not know yet who vote on Election Day .  Because of early vote turnout , and base on who be leave to vote on Election Day — namely voter who vote on Election Day in 2012 , I modify that projection to 9 .  5 million late during the second week of early voting , and assume 3 percent of those would vote for someone else , this meant slightly over 9 .  2 million would vote for either Trump or Clinton .  I be assume go into Election Day , we be at about 67-68 percent of our total turnout , and while the Democrats have a 96,000 lead among registered voter head into Election Day , I be operate from a place that her lead be between 3-4 percent , largely due to the overwhelmingly diverse nature of the NPA vote , which would put her raw vote lead between 180-250K vote .

However , with much of the remain vote still come in be from heavily Democratic area , Romney 's Florida campaign acknowledge that he have lose the state to Obama .  5 Both Miami-Dade and Broward County complete their ballot count on November 8 , leave Palm Beach and Duval county a the only two that do not have a final count at the end of the day .  6 Florida require all county to finish counting by noon Saturday but would not announce an official winner until the vote be certify on November 20 .  86 % , with all but one county finish with their counting .
***** Too many day out to be write memo about vote by mail Date .  Well 2020 be different in every way possible , not the least of which be the rapid change in how people be choose to vote .

To give a sense of scale , about 500,000 Floridians have vote by mail at this point in 2016 .  In other word without even talk about partisan change in how people be vote , a lot more people be vote by mail .  Following the debacle of 2000 and no I be not talk about the Jaguars defensive inability to contain Steve McNair in the AFC Championship follow the 2000 recount , the State of Florida make vote absentee an excuse-free option and Republicans , use their institutional funding advantage , build up a vote by mail machine .  Back in my State House campaign day , we would just assume that wed start several thousand vote behind in every campaign , because they be able to bank real vote and even in 2008 , despite u try to close the gap , more than 200,000 more Republicans than Democrats vote by mail .  Democrats have progressively do well in vote by mail , Republicans with in-person early voting .  35 million VBM request , Democrats have a roughly 5,700 request average but because Republicans have a high return rate , when all be say and do , about 58,000 more Republicans vote by mail than Democrats .

***** In the current research , we investigate whether belief in conspiracy theory satisfy people ’ s need for uniqueness .  We find that the tendency to believe in conspiracy theory be associate with the feeling of possess scarce information about the situation explain by the conspiracy theory ( Study 1 ) and high need for uniqueness ( Study 2 ) .  Further two study use two different manipulation of need for uniqueness ( Studies 3 and 4 ) show that people in a high need for uniqueness condition display high conspiracy belief than people in a low need for uniqueness condition .  These study suggest that conspiracy theory may serve people ’ s desire to be unique , highlight a motivational underpinning of conspiracy belief .  , the 2001 tsunami in Japan ) , many people start to disbelieve official explanation in favor of what be know a conspiracy theory .  For example , one conspiracy theory attribute the Charlie Hebdo attack to Mossad a an effort to make Muslims look bad .  In recent year , psychologist have make significant ground in understand what draw people to conspiracy theory .  , 2010 , 2011 ) , narcissism ( Cichocka , Marchlewska , & Golec de Zavala , 2016 ) , and Machiavellianism ( Douglas & Sutton , 2011 ) be associate with conspiracy belief .  In term of cognitive process , people with strong conspiracy belief be more likely to overestimate the likelihood of co-occurring event ( Brotherton & French , 2014 ) , to attribute intentionality where it be unlikely to exist ( Brotherton & French , 2015 ; Douglas , Sutton , Callan , Dawtry , & Harvey , 2016 ) , and to have low level of analytic thinking ( Swami , Voracek , Stieger , Tran , & Furnham , 2014 ) .  Further , some research suggest that conspiracy theory may perform certain function for the self , allow people to regain a sense of control ( van Prooijen & Acker , 2015 ; Whitson & Galinsky , 2008 ) , order ( van Harreveld , Rutjens , Schneider , Nohlen , & Keskinis , 2014 ) , power ( Gray , 2010 ; Sapountzis & Condor , 2013 ) , and to relieve death anxiety ( Newheiser , Farias , & Tausch , 2011 ) .  The current research aim to further contribute to current knowledge about the personal need that may be satisfy by conspiracy belief .  Among the self-related motivation that could influence belief in conspiracy theory , we will argue that the need for uniqueness should play a role in people ’ s adherence to conspiracy theory .  More specifically , our general claim be that people with a high need for uniqueness should be more likely to believe in conspiracy theory .  OverviewIn the current research , we test the overarch hypothesis that the desire to feel unique should foster belief in conspiracy theory .  Thus , in Study 1 , we test whether people who endorse conspiracy theory be more likely to think that they possess scarce and secret information about various conspiracy theory .  Hence , in Study 2 , we test whether people with a high need for uniqueness also believe in conspiracy theory to a large extent .  Of course , it could be that people believe in conspiracy theory without have information about them .  Study 2After establish in Study 1 that belief in conspiracy theory could serve the purpose of feel unique , the goal of Study 2 be to directly test whether people with a chronic high need for uniqueness believe in conspiracy theory to a large extent .  without mention the expression “ conspiracy theory .  Results and DiscussionWe first test our main prediction , that people with a high need for uniqueness should have a high level of belief in conspiracy theory .  In line with this hypothesis and with our preliminary work , we find that a high need for uniqueness ( measure by the Self-Attributed Need for Uniqueness scale ) be associate with high belief in conspiracy theory ( measure with the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale ) , r ( 206 ) = .  Then , we test the relationship between the three underlie factor of need for uniqueness and conspiracy belief ( both linear and quadratic regression ) .  To avoid the use of too many statistical test , we combine our two measure of belief in conspiracy theory ( i .  Among these test , only one test be significant for this threshold , namely the positive linear relationship between the desire to not always follow rule and belief in conspiracy theory , r ( 206 ) = .  Theoretically , this effect be consistent with the stereotypical picture of the “ out from the crowd ” believer in conspiracy theory .  To test this hypothesis , after prim need for uniqueness , we measure belief in a ( potentially ) newly form conspiracy theory ( see Bost & Prunier , 2013 ; van Prooijen & Jostmann , 2013 ; van Prooijen & van Dijk , 2014 , for similar procedure ) .  This bogus newspaper article be sufficiently ambiguous to enable participant to believe it could be the result of a conspiracy .  The article be design such that it could potentially raise suspicion about a conspiracy ( e .  Belief in a Conspiracy TheoryOur main hypothesis be that the manipulation of need for uniqueness should induce a high level of adherence to a conspiracy theory in the individuality condition than in the conformity condition .  Although the effect find in this study be only marginal , it suggest that the tendency to believe in a conspiracy can be influence by the need for uniqueness .  Belief in a Conspiracy TheoryHowever , another independent sample t-test on the belief in a conspiracy theory measure confirm our prediction that participant in the “ different be well ” condition have a high level of conspiracy belief ( M = 5 .  We again find that participant in the need for uniqueness condition have marginally high level of belief in the conspiracy theory .  General DiscussionThe purpose of this paper be to empirically test the proposition that conspiracy belief can serve a a mean to satisfy people ’ s need for uniqueness .  In Study 2 , we use a correlational design to demonstrate that participant with high need for uniqueness believe more in conspiracy theory .  Our finding can also be connect to recent research demonstrating that individual narcissism , or a grandiose idea of the self , be positively relate to belief in conspiracy theory ( Cichocka et al .

And in term of how we measure the extent to which people believe in conspiracy theory , you can do this in a variety of different way .  And a a social psychologist now , we would normally measure a belief in conspiracy theory by simply ask people question about the extent to which they endorse a particular idea or the extent to which they believe a particular statement be true .  And another way to tap into what some would argue be an underlying tendency to just believe conspiracy theory more generally .  And I guess time will tell if conspiracy theory have I guess , be on the rise in this particular point in time compare to time in the past or time in the future .  So it 's really difficult to tell , but it do make sense to me that there would have be particular period in history that conspiracy theory would have be more prominent .  Let 's talk a little bit about the psychological factor that motivate people to believe in conspiracy theory .  And some psychological evidence suggest that people be draw to conspiracy theory when they do feel uncertain either in specific situation or more generally .  And there be other epistemic reason why people believe in conspiracy theory as well in relation to this sort of need for knowledge and certainty .  And so reach to conspiracy theory might , I guess , at least allow people to feel that they have information that at least explains why they do n't have any control over this situation .  But yes , narcissism at an individual level have be associate in quite a few study now with belief in conspiracy theory .  So yes , narcissism be one of those individual difference , variable that correlate with belief in conspiracy theory .  Do you see any association between those and tendency to believe in conspiracy theory ? .  Another of your study find that people who believe in one conspiracy theory be more likely to believe in others , even when those theory directly contradict each other .  Obviously we kind of , I guess , start from the point that in the literature it 's often be find that if people believe in one conspiracy theory , then they 're likely to believe in others .  We think people would not entertain these two conspiracy theory at the same time , but it turn out that they do , or at least they be prepare to entertain the idea that both of those thing might be true .  But we also measure the extent to which people believe in , I guess , an underlying conspiracy theory that something just be n't right .  And what we find be that some people do indeed endorse these contradictory conspiracy theory , or again , at least be likely to entertain those two idea at the same time .  It 's very true that some conspiracy theory stand the test of time and others just disappear .  I think that there must be certain feature of conspiracy theory , the one that last and the one that do n't .  Is there any way to effectively debunk a conspiracy theory once it 's out there ? .  How do you address conspiracy theory ? .  So , be there a way for people to balance this awareness with a healthy skepticism of conspiracy theory ? .  So , what aspects of conspiracy theory be you look at today ? .  I 'm really interested in , I guess , the deliberate use of conspiracy theory a a political device .  So , I 've be do some research , I guess , look at how people perceive others who seem to use conspiracy theory , and whether or not they see those action a intentional or deliberate , and also what the effect be of that .  I 've also be interested in the term conspiracy theory itself and the term conspiracy theorist and how people use those term , whether they use them to , I guess , specifically put down other people 's idea , or if they simply use these term when they just do n't believe .

This study investigate how exposure to and trust in information source , and anxiety and depression , be associate with conspiracy and misinformation belief in eight countries/regions ( Belgium , Canada , England , Philippines , Hong Kong , New Zealand , United States , Switzerland ) during the COVID-19 pandemic .  Results indicate that great exposure to traditional medium ( television , radio , newspaper ) be associate with low conspiracy and misinformation belief , while exposure to politician and digital medium and personal contact be associate with great conspiracy and misinformation belief .

Introduction While the SARS-CoV-2 virusresponsible for cause the COVID-19 diseasespreads aggressively and rapidly across the globe , many society have also witness the spread of other seemingly viral phenomenon such a fake news , conspiracy theory , and general mass suspicion about what be really go on .  Some of the most prevailing narrative be the one claim that the virus be cause by 5G cellular technology ( Vincent , 2020 ) or that Bill Gates use the virus to enslave humanity by enforce a global vaccination and surveillance program ( Shahsavari et al .  Even though most of these story be quickly debunk and prove untrue , the pervasiveness of misinformation and conspiracy theory on social medium and in the news cycle have lead the Director-General of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to warn that Were not just fight an epidemic ; be fight an infodemic .  As a result , narrative of conspiracy theory and misinformation spread quickly ( Venturini , 2019 ; Gallotti et al .  , 2020 ) , a rumor , conspiracy theory , and alternative truth tend to thrive in environment of high fear , low confidence , and low trust ( Shahsavari et al .

It be easy to dismiss conspiracy theory a unhinged belief hold by a small number of paranoid idiot , but that seriously underestimate them .  One reason , say psychologist , be that it be perfectly reasonable , because conspiracy sometimes happen .

***** The idea have be debunk numerous time , whereas there be good evidence that conspiracy theorist such a David Icke be themselves reap huge profit from spread misinformation .  The conspiracy theorist David Icke at an anti-lockdown protest in Birmingham last month .  Christopher Furlong/GettySince many conspiracy theory arise from feel of uncertainty and fear , an angry debate will only cement the idea , and open ridicule be even less constructive ( see panel , below ) .  Fortunately , the exponent of these conspiracy theory often use the same rhetorical device , and a familiarity with these argument will help you to politely articulate the faulty reason behind many different form of misinformation .  a tactic that be commonly use in many conspiracy theory .  Fake authorityIf they can ’ t present any solid scientific evidence , conspiracy theorist may name impressive-sounding witness who apparently endorse their worldview .

***** And those two word be “ conspiracy theory .  ” From CrowdStrike to speculation about Jeffrey Epstein ’ s death , conspiracy theory have become central talk point in American politics and culture or at least that ’ s how it feel on the internet .  It ’ s common for people to believe in conspiracy theory .  So common that recent work suggest everyone believe in at least one conspiracy theory .  “ Journalists be say that ‘ now be the time of conspiracy theory .  ’ But they ’ ve say that almost every year since the 1960s , ” say Joe Uscinski , a political scientist at the University of Miami who study the origin and behavior associate with conspiracy theory .  Aside from spike in the 1890s due to distrust in rise industrialization and during the Red Scare in the 1950s , public belief in conspiracy theory remain stable .  “ Based on the research that Ive do and that other psychologist have do , conspiracy think seem to be a fairly stable predisposition , ” say Robert Brotherton , a psychologist and lecturer at Barnard College , who study conspiracy theory .  He and other cognitive scientist describe be conspiracy mind or conspiracism to be like any other personality trait , with some people more predisposed and others less so .  It ’ s not a change that originate from our own susceptibility to conspiracy theory , but appear to be the news medium ’ s grow attention on them , a exemplify by this passage from Uscinski ’ s 2018 book “ Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them ” .  Yet the news medium ’ s fascination with conspiracy theory and it regular attempt at debunk them through fact checking may reinforce misplace belief and perpetuate public trust in conspiracy theory .  But do correctly , debunk can combat people ’ s faith in false conspiracy theory .  Defining the conspiracy theory People even smart and savvy one mix up conspiracy theory , falsehood and myth .

Those six element base rate , emotion , consistency , proportionality bias , intentionality bias and pattern search help explain why people believe in conspiracy theory .  If the backfire effect exist , then people might forget or ignore the context of a fact check and be leave with a strong belief in a conspiracy theory .

The chatter quickly turn to other conspiracy and I enjoy eavesdrop while the group brutally mock flat Earthers , chemtrails meme and Gwyneth Paltrow ’ s late idea .  One of the reason why conspiracy theory spring up with such regularity be due to our desire to impose structure on the world and incredible ability to recognise pattern .  Indeed , a recent study show a correlation between an individual ’ s need for structure and tendency to believe in a conspiracy theory .  Peer pressure Another reason we be so keen to believe in conspiracy theory be that we be social animal and our status in that society be much more important ( from an evolutionary standpoint ) than be right .

These proponent may not necessarily believe the conspiracy theory , instead use it in an attempt to gain public approval .

A look at the key element of a conspiracy theory help shed light on why the era of social medium , increase news consumption , and the confusion that come along with the COVID-19 pandemic create the perfect environment for conspiracy to emerge .  Conspiracy Theory A conspiracy theory be define a a theory that reject the standard explanation for an event and instead credit a covert group or organization with carry out a secret plot .  A conspiracy theorist be likely to believe that anyone who try to debunk their theory be in on it and part of the conspiracy themselves .  A study of the psychology of conspiracy theory break them down into five major element .  A group of dishonest , bad actor be work in conjunction towards a goal ( lone wolf explanation do not meet the definition of a conspiracy theory ) There be threat of harm to others from the conspirator .

***** Online , somebody they know and love have stumble into the treacherous world of online conspiracy theory and , in some case , might not even know it .  “ I would not advocate replace one conspiracy theory with another , but if these people be already wary of authority , it ’ s worth ask them question like , ‘ Whose interest do your online engagement serve ? .  In a recent article , Colin Dickey , an author and academic who have spend time write about conspiracy theory , argue that his first step be to acknowledge that some conspiracy do exist — Watergate , the Catholic Church ’ s sexual abuse scandal , the billionaire Jeffrey Epstein ’ s network of underage sexual abuse .  This , he argue , create a bit of common ground and lay the foundation to explore how unproven conspiracy theory differ from reality .  “ I try to show how these conspiracy play out , ” he tell me .  ’ I explain how , in past conspiracy , there be usually some whistle-blower or news report , and then the whole thing unravels quickly .  Because conspiracy theory become fused with people ’ s political and cultural identity , debate a true believer can be counterproductive .
***** 15 , 2021 Think of a conspiracy theorist .  It can be easy to write off our conspiracy theorist friend and relative a crackpot , but science show thing be far more nuanced than that .  One study find that people with this bias be more likely to endorse conspiracy belief than people without it , and it ’ s also be find to be correlate with harbor delusion .  It ’ s not surprise that someone who tend to make up their mind about something after review very little evidence would be more likely to believe in a conspiracy theory .  Many of the study only observe a correlation — which we all know do not necessarily equal causation — between certain trait and conspiracy theory .  Just because people who believe conspiracy theory be also more likely to have trait X doesn ’ t mean that it ’ s trait X that ’ s make them susceptible — the two might just go together .  And even if there be a causal effect , that still doesn ’ t mean that everyone with trait X will subscribe to a conspiracy theory , or that everyone who doesn ’ t have trait X be immune to b .  » “ It ’ s all probabilistic , ” say Joshua Hart , a professor of psychology at Union College who have study the personality trait of people prone to believe conspiracy theory .  ” Still , this research be useful and help u establish a rich picture of who be susceptible to conspiracy theory .  Respondents who believe there be some kind of predetermined pattern to the coin toss sequence be more likely to believe conspiracy theory .  Making connection between unrelated event or symbol be a key marker of many conspiracy theory .  But they demonstrate that conspiracy theorist aren ’ t just loony — many of the trait that can set someone up to believe wild idea be thing all of u be prone to , to some degree .  JOEY ELLISCognitive quirk only go so far in explain why people believe conspiracy theory .  ” This might help explain why belief in conspiracy theory be surprisingly common .

***** Although vaccine hesitancy be a complex problem with multiple cause , the number of conspiracy theory circulate about the coronavirus do not help .  The fight against COVID-19-related conspiracy theory will be fight on multiple front .  Most people will know someone who have succumb to conspiracy theory about the current crisis .  I have be research conspiracy theory for over two decade and have speak to many believer .  Here be the six rule I use for talk to conspiracy theorist in the effort to change their mind .  When it come to conspiracy theory , the world be not divide into “ believer ” and “ sceptic ” .  Many others might not see themselves a “ believer ” , but be willing to accept that conspiracy theorist might be onto something and be at least ask the right question .  Also , try and find out what specific conspiracy theory they endorse .  So when talk about conspiracy theory , start by acknowledge these broad concern and restrict your discussion to whether conspiracy theory can provide an adequate or meaningful answer .  Many people come to conspiracy theory through genuine , albeit misguide , curiosity about how to make sense of the world .  The kernel of truth on which conspiracy theory be base be a solid starting point for a discussion .  You may want to point out that throughout history , conspiracy theory have come up short .  There be no incontestable argument or fail-proof strategy that will always convert a conspiracy theorist to scepticism .
***** They 're call conspiracy theorist .  There seem to be a conspiracy be `` uncover `` all the time these day , and no matter how outlandish they may be , they seem to have no trouble draw in ardent believer .  Despite the prevalence and pervasiveness of conspiracy theory , the reason people be draw to them be a relatively new area of study for psychologist .  According to University of Chicago political science professor Eric Oliver and Thomas Wood , in any give year roughly half of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory .  President Trump himself have express a belief in at least two of the above conspiracy at one time or another .  Everyone 's a suspect Conspiracy theorist can be conservative , liberal or any other political stripe — male or female , rich or poor , well educate or not .  Among the cognitive bias Van Prooijen and other psychologist believe contribute to the appeal of conspiracy theory be .  Yet , there be factor that make some people more or less inclined to accept conspiracy theory .  But a few document remain classify , which be more than enough mystery to keep the conspiracy theory around the assassination alive .  `` I ’ ve learn that be there no such thing a evidence that persuade a conspiracy theorist , `` Posner say .  Van Prooijen also call conspiracy theory a `` form of belief .  `` It ’ s very easy to dismiss evidence a be part of the conspiracy , be part of the coverup .  So it ’ s very hard to disprove a conspiracy theory .
***** To be an American in 2020 be to live in a petri dish ideal for grow conspiracy theory .  Before the pandemic hit , Adam Enders , an assistant professor at the University of Louisville who research how conspiracy theory affect politics , have already note that conspiracy think be become increasingly weaponize for political purpose .  “ This pandemic be ripe ground for conspiracy theory , precisely because a lot of the psychological element that give rise to conspiracy theory be heighten .  ” Research into conspiracy theory have find no innate correlation between conspiracy thinking and left-right political orientation .  ” In the misinformation pandemic , conspiracy theory occupy an increasingly commonplace part of mainstream political discourse , political leader weaponize them for their partisan benefit , and neutral , trust source of information lose sway .  Like a virus , once a conspiracy theory start spread , it be difficult to contain .  “ What ’ s a trust source for somebody who be literally define by think that everyone and everything be a lie and against them and a conspiracy ? .  We have mass demonstration follow the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , and come out of them , many different conspiracy theory and misinformation .  Is a time like this sort of a perfect storm for conspiracy theory ? .  Some people be motivate to believe or spread conspiracy theory for partisan reason .  What do it take to be a “ conspiracy theorist ” ? .  To have some level of doubt about one conspiracy theory out there ? .  Once we think about conspiracy think on a continuum , there ’ s more nuance .  If we ’ re talk about general level of belief in conspiracy theory , thing probably aren ’ t that different today than the past .  Something be attractive about conspiracy theory that draw you to them .  What you ’ re describing , where it seem like there be many more blatantly partisan conspiracy theory out there — that ’ s probably true .  And you find that Republicans be more likely to believe a conspiracy theory when it be blame on Democrats — and I should note , the reverse be also true .  Democrats be more likely to believe a conspiracy theory when it be pin on Republicans .  Some of these conspiracy theory be not really emanate from psychological , conspiracy thinking-esque source ; they ’ re just partisan mudslinging .  And give his embrace of conspiracy theory before he enter politics , do that suggest that he approach conspiracy theory driven less by partisan motivate reason than by conspiracy thinking ? .  If they function a signal — a way to show allegiance to one side or the other , or to assert your identity — how do you go about try to correct or combat a conspiracy theory when it ’ s tie to something so personal for the person who believe in it , when it seem tie to their identity ? .  And at the same time , if a conspiracy theory have partisan overtone , it ’ s almost like people see a correction a have partisan overtone , too .  The thing be , if your own ideological identity motivate you to believe a conspiracy theory , you ’ re not necessarily an extremist , but you be a partisan , and you probably think of yourself a a liberal or conservative .  What ’ s a trusted source for somebody who be literally define by think that everyone and everything be a lie and against them and a conspiracy ? .  How do you differentiate between conspiracy theory and misinformation or disinformation ? .  Defining “ conspiracy theory ” be tricky .  Most of u that do this work , you have to sort of believe that truth exists on a continuum to even be able to cobble together a reasonable definition of “ conspiracy theory ” that do n't accidentally either encompass everything or mean nothing .  So , conspiracy thinking , conspiracy theory be sort of a subset of misinformation .  How do a conspiracy theory end ? .  The only way that I can think of that they truly end be that we find evidence for it , and then we just call it a conspiracy .  But this also point to why conspiracy theory be such interesting device .

***** If Earth be flat , youd know it , because a lot of thing would work differently .  If you subscribe to the idea of a flat Earth , then you ’ d believe that no such thing happen , because the sun rotate in a circle around the sky .  Humans have know for thousand of year that the planet be round , yet the belief in a flat Earth refuse to die .  Let ’ s examine , then , how the well-known principle of physic and science would work ( or not ) on a flat Earth .  It ’ s unclear how gravity would work , or be create , in such a world , say James Davis , a geophysicist at Columbia University ’ s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory .  People who believe in a flat Earth assume that gravity would pull straight down , but there ’ s no evidence to suggest it would work that way .  The flat Earth model place our planet at the center of the universe , but doesn ’ t suggest that the sun orbit the Earth .  Without the linear , perpendicular momentum that help generate an orbit , it ’ s unclear what force would keep the sun and moon hovering above the Earth , Davis say , instead of crash into it .  Likewise , in a flat world , satellite likely wouldn ’ t be possible .  “ There be a number of satellite mission that society depend on that just wouldn ’ t work , ” Davis say .  For this reason , he say , “ I can not think of how GPS would work on a flat Earth .  ” If the sun and moon just loop around one side of a flat Earth , there could presumably be a procession of day and night .  But in a flat planet , that would have to be replace by something else .  Perhaps a flat sheet of liquid metal .  all circumnavigation of the earth be easily explainable on the flat earth model .  No pilot believe the earth to be flat , either , a navigation only work on a globe .

We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men.
***** A series of video-based intervention message in biographic narrative format ( firsthand experiential story share by men who have sex with men ) combine with topic-equivalent argumentative message be produce and program into 6 intervention session .  The biographic narrative interview method be use to elicit firsthand experiential story from a maximum variation sample of local men who have sex with men with diverse background and experience relate to HIV prevention ; different type of role model be establish accordingly .  In this study , we aim to ( 1 ) capitalize on narrative persuasion to design a web-based multisession intervention for reduce condomless anal intercourse among men who have sex with men in Hong Kong ( the HeHe Talks Project ) by follow a systematic development process ; and ( 2 ) describe the main component of the narrative intervention that potentially determine it persuasiveness .  In the era of potent antiretroviral therapy , a high level of condomless anal intercourse continue to drive increase in HIV incidence in recent year among men who have sex with men .  Introduction Men Who Have Sex With Men a an Important Target for HIV Prevention Although a steadily decrease trend have be observe for the global HIV burden , the epidemic have continue to expand among men who have sex with men [ ] .  54 % among men who have sex with men in recent year , while the rate have remain low than 0 .  Despite biomedical advance in antiretroviral therapy and grow access to care and treatment , there be a paradoxical rise in the HIV incidence rate among men who have sex with men that be find to be significantly associate with an increase in condomless anal intercourse [ , ] .  For instance , intervention for HIV prevention be commonly develop to target high-risk group who engage in unprotected sex or have a low intention to use condom consistently .  Utilizing Web-Based HIV Prevention Interventions for Men Who Have Sex With Men Web-based technology have be recognize a a powerful tool to efficiently reach target population and deliver behavioral intervention to enhance response to the ongoing HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men [ ] .  A recent meta-analysis [ ] of 44 study across 12 country and region find that eHealth intervention effectively reduce condomless anal intercourse , reduce multiple sex partnership , and increase the uptake of HIV test among men who have sex with men .  Moreover , a considerable proportion of men who have sex with men actively use the internet for socialize and sex-seeking , which have be find to increase likelihood of condomless anal intercourse , and consequently , risk of HIV infection [ - ] .  In Hong Kong , approximately 70 % of men who have sex with men engage in sex-seeking online [ ] .  Hence , web-based intervention can seize the opportunity to promote HIV prevention among men who have sex with men at a crucial point when they tend to engage in risky sexual practice .  For example , the participant emphasize the phenomenon of “ complacency about HIV ” among local men who have sex with men ( ie , that strong belief about antiretroviral therapy efficacy contribute to low-risk perception and high motivation to engage in condomless anal intercourse ) .  research study demonstrate that there be no significant difference in HIV risk between men who have sex with men who “ inconsistently use condom ” and those who “ have never ever use condom .

***** One Approach be a 1983 manual by Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen , under the direction of Joseph Sonnabend , to advise men who have sex with men ( MSM ) about how to avoid contract the infecting agent which cause AIDS .  1 It be among the first publication to recommend the use of condom to prevent the transmission of STDs in men have sex with men , and have even be name , along with Play Fair .  , a one of the foundational publication in the advent of modern safe sex .  5 Should people with AIDS have sex ? .  6 Guilt , morality and sex negativity 2 .  5 Both Callen and Berkowitz have be diagnose with AIDS when they write the booklet and have a thorough knowledge of the sexual culture of gay and bisexual men in New York City .  7 The misconception that there be something inherent in the lifestyle of all gay men that put them at risk for infection be common at the time and lead to the development of a stigma surround both the disease and gay sex .  8 Doctor Sonnabend write that `` it may be impossible for those who do not directly experience the uncertainty and terror of the early year of AIDS to appreciate the circumstance under which these guideline [ for safe sex ] be construct .  `` anal sex with a condom become an endless back and forth dance , from high risk to medium risk to low risk to possibly safe .  `` 7 It be this confusion that prompt the author to create a safe sex manual that clearly outline for men have sex with men the danger of each type of contact and various method to protect oneself from exposure .  Media portrayal of HIV/AIDS After the Sexual Revolution and the Gay Liberation in the 1960s and ` 70 , sex in urban gay epicenter be not only newly acceptable , but also often see a key to gay identity and resistance to heteronormativity .  David France estimate that less than 1 % of men who have sex with men in New York City use them regularly in the 1970s , despite the fact that many other sexually transmit disease , include cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B , be already at `` endemic `` level .  [ edit ] Callen , Berkowitz and Sonnabend begin this section by state that , regardless of how controversial and subjective the question may be , some people with AIDS do continue to have sex after be infect , whether knowingly or unknowingly , although many may be so incapacitated that sex be `` the furthest thing from their mind .  In all likelihood , the author contend , the risk of unprotected sex to the person with AIDS be high than to the uninfected person , a any number of STDs can have a dangerous health impact on someone with a compromise immune system .  9 However , the reality be that the risk of have sex with someone with AIDS be high than they describe because it be cause by a single virus ( HIV ) that PWA ( and people with HIV pre-AIDS ) have and uninfected people do not .  In this section , the author discuss the difficulty pose by the obvious connection between gay sex and the disease , especially give that men who have sex with men , as well a transgender woman , be , even before the outbreak of AIDS , often accuse of have too much sex by the Moral Majority .
***** Click here for more recent article on this topic study from Orange Farm near Johannesburg in South Africa , the area that host the first-ever randomise control trial of male circumcision for HIV prevention , which conclude in 2005 , have find evidence that woman who be partner of circumcise men be less likely to have HIV themselves .  2009 meta-analysis ( Weiss ) of the benefit to woman of circumcise men find no evidence that have sex with a circumcise , rather than an uncircumcised , man reduce the risk of HIV infection to woman , though there have be study that show that male circumcision reduce the risk of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) and genital herpes ( HSV2 ) in woman .  although the benefit be quite small , in the order of a 15 % reduction in prevalence in woman who only have sex with circumcised men .

Since Bophelo Pele start , the proportion of local men who be circumcise have rise from 15 % to 53 % and a recent survey find that HIV prevalence in the area be 50 % low in circumcise than uncircumcised men .  Although the survey of men last year find that HIV prevalence in uncircumcised men be 19 % and circumcise men 7 % ( average be 12 % ) , in woman prevalence be 30 % , and in the peak age of 30-34 rise to 38 % .
***** FUTURE DIRECTIONSReferencesCITING ARTICLESMost HIV prevention literature portray woman a especially vulnerable to HIV infection because of biological susceptibility and men 's sexual power and privilege .  Conversely , heterosexual men be perceive a active transmitter of HIV but not active agent in prevention .  3 Meanwhile , men who have sex with woman remain a forgotten group in the epidemic,4 almost entirely unaddressed in HIV prevention program .  According to this paradigm , woman be susceptible to HIV because of biological difference in susceptibility , reduce sexual autonomy , and men 's sexual power and privilege .  Conversely , heterosexual men be active transmitter of HIV but not active agent of prevention .  The paradigm assume not only that woman ( but not men ) want to prevent HIV but lack the power to do so , but also that men be more likely than woman to bring HIV into the partnership .  The model tend to ignore how heterosexual men contract HIV themselves and how variability in biosocial and cultural context influence woman 's and men 's probability of infection if expose .  Moreover , the model assume that woman want to protect themselves , but men do not .  Similarly , men , but not woman , be presume to engage deliberately in risky practice .  Finally , the paradigm applies gendered , structural understanding and intervention to woman 's behaviors9 but not to men 's , especially heterosexual men 's .  Upwards of 70 % of transmission worldwide be now between a man and a woman,10 but program and policy largely fail to include the prevention need of men who have sex with woman .  13 Close identification of the virus with gay men , and later injection drug user , mean that researcher fail to recognize or focus on heterosexual transmission for many year after the first case be diagnose in the United States .  22But visibility do not automatically lead to increase public health aid to HIV-positive woman .  ( This phenomenon would be see with prostitute in several other part of the world , among whom AIDS be consider to be a largely feminized disease from which men need to be protect .  Furthermore , even among feminist advocate , effort to feminize the discourse be slow after the disease have be identify with gay men for so long .  13 Surveillance statistic , however , show that heterosexual transmission account for more infection among woman than men , suggest that woman might be at great risk of infection if expose through heterosexual intercourse .  Indeed , feminist research and advocacy both in the United States and internationally bolster the vulnerability model by describe the myriad way in which gender inequality could put woman at risk for HIV in their primary relationship with men .  Despite the fact that heterosexual men , too , be infect with HIV ( and can not infect a woman without be infect themselves ) , HIV risk translate into vulnerability only for woman , who unlike men be consider deserve of protection from AIDS .  One rarely encounter “ vulnerability ” a an operative word in the literature regard US Black or Latino men , let alone African men , men who have sex with men , or male injection drug user , even though these group be also hinder by power differential involve race , ethnicity , social class , sexuality , and global structure of inequality .  The “ Fixed Fact ” of Women 's Biologic VulnerabilitySusser write that “ heterosexual transmission , ” the term most often use in public health literature to “ index the problem of woman contract HIV through sex with men , ” can render invisible the difference in risk of infection between men and woman .  In set in which men be not circumcise or sexually transmitted infection prevalence be high , for example , gender difference be diminished,90 and men and woman have far more similar probability of infect or be infect than in other setting .  ( 1 ) woman want to prevent HIV when have sexual intercourse with a potentially infected man , but lack the power to do so , and ( 2 ) men be more likely than woman to bring HIV into the partnership because they engage in more sexual and drug use risk behavior .  Heterosexual men be perceive a active transmitter of HIV but not a active agent in prevention .  Multiple Sexual PartnersThe vulnerability paradigm also rest on the assumption that men be more likely than woman to bring HIV into the partnership .  119 Moreover , current demographic and health survey and other population-based survey support the notion that men be much more likely than woman to be unfaithful to a cohabiting partner .  However , in the large epidemic in the world , the dominant HIV epidemiology do not take the form of a few men infect a large pool of woman .

The effect on the deficit depend on how enrollee who be eligible for tax credit and Medicaid — those who have little financial reason to drop coverage — respond to the penalty ’ s elimination .  The ACA far encourage enrollment by offer tax credit to people who purchase insurance on the individual market and have low to moderate income ( 100 % to 400 % of the federal poverty level , or roughly between $ 25,000 and $ 98,000 for a family of four ) and no other affordable source of coverage .

When the ACA be write , the expectation be that coverage would be affordable without subsidy at that income level .  This be not surprising give the sharp premium increase in 2017 and 2018 , which cause coverage to become unaffordable for some people who earn a little too much to qualify for subsidy ( although rate have stabilize in 2019 and 2020 , theyre still too high to be affordable in many area when a households income be just a little above the subsidy eligibility cap ) .

Conclusions and Relevance Policy maker should build on progress make by the Affordable Care Act by continue to implement the Health Insurance Marketplaces and delivery system reform , increase federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollee , introduce a public plan option in area lack individual market competition , and take action to reduce prescription drug cost .  I also have to deal with one of the nation ’ s most intractable and long-standing problem , a health care system that fell far short of it potential .  In 2008 , the United States devote 16 % of the economy to health care , an increase of almost one-quarter since 1998 ( when 13 % of the economy be spend on health care ) , yet much of that spending do not translate into good outcome for patient .

That 10-year increase be the net result of change that go in opposite direction .  Lower project interest rate and high estimate of wage , salary , and proprietor ’ income reduce project deficit , but a combination of recent legislation and other change increase them ( see Appendix A ) .  That increase be largely the result of legislation enact since June—which decrease revenue and increase discretionary outlays—and of low project GDP ( see Box 1-1 ) .  The cumulative deficit currently project for the next 10 year be slightly large than what CBO project last August because deficit increase result from new legislation and other change be great than the deficit-reducing effect of revision to CBO ’ s economic forecast .  Beyond 2030 , project deficit have increase substantially .  The project gap between spending and revenue increase to 5 .  Over the same period , federal debt and interest rate be both project to rise , cause net outlay for interest to increase steadily , from 1 .  High and rise federal debt would reduce national saving and income , boost the government ’ s interest payment , limit policymakers ’ ability to respond to unforeseen event , and increase the likelihood of a fiscal crisis .  Total revenue a a share of GDP be project to rise , primarily because of increase in individual income tax .  Driving those increase be the expiration of certain provision of the 2017 tax act ( at the end of calendar year 2025 ) and real bracket creep—the process in which , a income rise fast than inflation , a large proportion of income becomes subject to high tax rate .

Evidence shows Zika virus turns fetus brains to liquid.
***** The 5 most troubling question scientist still have about Zika Before last year , scientist know very little about the Zika virus .  Research on the virus be so limited , in fact , that printout of all the world 's publish literature could basically fit into a shoebox .  After the mosquito-borne virus explode around Brazil last year , move on to most of Latin America and the Caribbean , an effort to good understand Zika be on .  It would have just be a strange , mostly benign virus that only affect about 20 percent of infected people with flu-like symptom .  But the outbreak grab everyone 's attention once new evidence suggest that woman infect with Zika during pregnancy could give birth to baby with microcephaly , a condition that 's characterize by a shrunken head and incomplete brain development .  Proving that Zika cause microcephaly — or not — be currently the key question about this virus .
***** Stories keep journal author in touch with industry development , support and training Industry development , policy and initiative of interest to our journal editor and editorial board member Information for reviewer about relevant Elsevier and industry development , support and training Why do Zika virus infect brain cell in fetus but not adult ? .  Two study in EBioMedicine begin to explain the link between Zika and microcephaly in baby A fetal brain cell line 24 hour after Zika infection .  Omar Bagsara ) Since 2015 , Zika virus have cause devastation for thousand of family in South America .  While infection in adult usually cause no symptom , if a woman be infect when pregnant the virus can damage brain cell in the unborn fetus .  The result have be thousand of case of microcephaly a condition in which the baby be bear with an abnormally small head and brain .  Widespread fear cause by the link between the Zika virus epidemic and an increase in case of microcephaly have ripple through South and Central America .  But Zika be relatively harmless to the adult infect with the virus , only cause mild symptom such a fever , headache , mild rash and joint pain in a minority of case .  Two study publish in EBioMedicine go some way to explain this phenomenon , reveal that Zika virus head straight for stem cell in the brain .  The result reveal that Zika infect stem cell in the brain , alter the way they grow .
***** This review include the congenital infection best know by the acronym TORCH ( Toxoplasma gondii , rubella virus , cytomegalovirus , and herpes virus ) , as well a Zika virus infection and perinatally acquire infection ( enterovirus , parechovirus , rotavirus , parvovirus ) .  Congenital infection be due to pathogen that can cross the placenta and be more likely to injure the brain when the infection occur early in pregnancy .
***** It cause a birth defect call microcephaly and other brain problem .  Zika virus also spread through mosquito bite and through body fluid , like blood and semen .  If you 're pregnant and think you may have be expose to Zika virus , see your health care provider right away .  Zika be a virus that can cause serious problem during pregnancy .  If you 're pregnant and infected with Zika virus , you can pass it to your baby .  Zika infection during pregnancy cause a birth defect call microcephaly and other brain problem .  You can get infect from a mosquito that carry the Zika virus , and a mosquito can get the virus by bite an infected person .  If you ’ re pregnant and may have be expose to Zika virus before or during pregnancy , see your provider .
***** The World Health Organization say in late March that there be “ strong scientific consensus ” that the Zika virus cause microcephaly , in which infant be bear with unusually small head and damage brain .  On April 13 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention go far , declare , “ It be now clear that the Zika virus cause microcephaly .  reach it conclusion not because of a single large study but because of “ mount evidence from many study , ” which collectively satisfy a set of criterion use to test whether a particular threat to a fetus cause a particular birth defect .  Virtually all public health agency be now give medical advice base on the belief that the virus be to blame for microcephaly .  Not all turn out to be real case , but now that thousand of report have be investigate , the surge in microcephaly seem well establish .  After the woman abort the pregnancy , Zika virus be find in her blood and in the fetal brain .

Also , a case report yesterday in a second letter to The Lancet detail the presence of Zika virus particle in the breast milk of a New Caledonian woman infect with the virus last year , but no infection be note in her baby .  Microcephaly and other disordersThe first Lancet letter detail find in four fetus in French Polynesia whose amniotic fluid test positive for the virus during the territory 's Zika outbreak from September 2013 through March 2014 .  Three of the fetus have microcephaly , or small head .  The fourth have a thin corpus callosum , which be the bundle of fiber that connect the brain 's two hemisphere and aid in cognitive and other activity between the two side of the brain .  The three fetus with microcephaly have an absent corpus callosum .
***** - Click to Tweet Studying a new type of pinhead-size , lab-grown brain make with technology first suggest by three high school student , Johns Hopkins researcher have confirm a key way in which Zika virus cause microcephaly and other damage in fetal brain .  These so-called bioreactors , and the mini-brains they foster , should open other new and valuable window into human brain development , brain disorder and drug test — and perhaps even produce neuron for treatment of Parkinson ’ s disease and other disorder , the investigator say .  “ We have be work for three year to develop a good research model of brain development , and it ’ s fortunate we can now use this one to shed light on the major public health crisis pose by Zika infection , ” say Hongjun Song , Ph .  that Zika cause microcephaly — abnormally small brain and head — mainly by attack the neural progenitor cell that build the brain and turn them into virus factory .  That make work with the mini-brains expensive , give the high cost of the nutrient need to cultivate human stem cell in the lab , he say , as well a the expense of chemical growth factor that guide the tissue to organize itself like a real brain .  “ One thing the mini-brains allow u to do be to model the effect of Zika virus exposure during different stage of pregnancy , ” say Ming .

***** 1093/cid/ciw613 Abstract Zika virus ( ZIKV ) infection acquire during pregnancy be associate with congenital microcephaly .  We describe 2 case of ZIKV infection in woman in their 36th week of pregnancy whose fetus have preserve head circumference at birth and finding of subependymal cyst and lenticulostriate vasculopathy in postnatal imaging .  These represent the first sign of congenital brain injury acquire due to ZIKV in the third trimester .  Zika virus infection , infection/congenital , ultrasonography , central nervous system cyst , lenticulostriate vasculopathyZika virus ( ZIKV ) infection be generally benign .  Recent evidence show that infection acquire during pregnancy can cause congenital microcephaly associate with brain atrophy , ventriculomegaly , calcification , and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis [ 2 , 3 ] .  Reports be subsequently publish that demonstrate the isolation of genetic material of ZIKV in amniotic fluid [ 4 ] , in the conceptus postmortem include in the brain [ 5 , 6 ] , and in material from miscarriage of microcephalic fetus of mother with confirmed maternal viremia [ 2 , 5 ] .

***** You ’ ve heard about how this mosquito-borne virus be barrel through the southern Americas , namely Brazil , and how it ’ s potentially link to microcephaly , a condition wherein newborn be bear with shrunken head and severe disability .  The World Health Organization say Thursday the virus could infect up to 4 million people this year .  But do you know there ’ s already another virus in the U .  associate with ten of thousand of case of brain defect , include microcephaly , each year ? .  How do Zika virus become such a menace to mother ? .  What be Zika virus and how might it disintegrate a develop brain ? .  A sterile female Aedes aegypti mosquito be see in a research area to prevent the spread of Zika virus and other mosquito-borne disease , at the entomology department of the Ministry of Public Health , in Guatemala City , January 28 , 2016 .  Most virus in this family be carry by arthropod mosquito and tick .  Doctors have find Zika genetic material in fetal tissue from early miss abortion , amniotic fluid surround the fetus and in the brain of newborn with microcephaly .
***** When Brazil ’ s alarm spike in newborn with brain damage be link to an obscure virus last year , Arnold Kriegstein begin to do some reading .  Kriegstein , a neurobiologist at the University of California , San Francisco , learn that the Zika virus be name after the forest in Uganda where it be first discover in 1947 .  But in late 2015 , month after it appear in Brazil , baby there begin to be bear with microcephaly , an underdeveloped brain , in surprisingly large number .  There be now enough evidence—especially the presence of the virus in the brain of stillborn infants—to suggest that Zika be the cause .  But scientist know next to nothing about how a virus could infect fetal brain cell and inhibit brain growth .  A 2015 paper reveal that the virus need the presence of a receptor call AXL to infect certain cell .  His lab have be study stem cell find inside the develop brain , and he know that AXL receptor coat these cell in a thick carpet .  The receptor be also present in a limited number of other cell , include one that make up the blood vessel head into the brain and neural support cell like astrocyte and glia .

The GD41-inoculated animal , experience fetal death 7 day later , have high virus level in fetal and placental tissue , implicate ZIKV a cause of death .  The other three fetus be carry to near term and euthanized ; while none display gross microcephaly , all show ZIKV RNA in many tissue , especially in the brain , which exhibit calcification and reduced neural precursor cell .  IntroductionFetuses from pregnant woman infect with Zika virus ( ZIKV ) sometimes display reduced growth , arthrogryposis , ocular calcification , skeletal and sensory disorder , and central nervous system ( CNS ) malformation include calcification and aberrant neural cell development1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 , manifestation that be together termed congenital Zika syndrome9,10,11 .  Animal model of human ZIKV infection in pregnancy be essential for determine pathogenesis and long-term effect on the infant brain , as well a treatment or vaccine to control or prevent infection and teratogenic effect in pregnant woman .  Although ZIKV-infected mouse show fetal growth restriction , brain infection , and in some system , CNS lesions similar to those see in humans12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 , significant difference in CNS development between mouse and human remain a limitation of murine model .  Fetuses of 4/5 pigtail macaque whose mother be deliver repeat subcutaneous high-dose inoculation in second or third trimester show ZIKV-associated brain lesion , similar to those see in human fetuses8 , include ependymal injury in the posterior lateral ventricle and periventricular gliosis25,33 .

***** Patients who undergo image at IPESQ be include , as well a those with documented Zika virus infection in fluid or tissue ( n = 17 , confirm infection cohort ) or those with brain find suspicious for Zika virus infection , with intracranial calcification ( n = 28 , presume infection cohort ) .  Imaging examination include 12 fetal magnetic resonance ( MR ) examination , 42 postnatal brain compute tomographic examination , and 11 postnatal brain MR examination .  ResultsBrain abnormality see in confirm ( n = 17 ) and presume ( n = 28 ) congenital Zika virus infection be similar , with ventriculomegaly in 16 of 17 ( 94 % ) and 27 of 28 ( 96 % ) infection , respectively ; abnormality of the corpus callosum in 16 of 17 ( 94 % ) and 22 of 28 ( 78 % ) infection , respectively ; and cortical migrational abnormality in 16 of 17 ( 94 % ) and 28 of 28 ( 100 % ) infection , respectively .  Although most fetus undergo at least one examination that show head circumference below the 5th percentile , head circumference could be normal in the presence of severe ventriculomegaly ( see in three fetus ) .  ConclusionThe spectrum of find associate with congenital Zika virus infection in the IPESQ in northeastern Brazil be illustrate to aid the radiologist in identify Zika virus infection at imaging .  IntroductionMuch have be write recently regard Zika virus in pregnancy and the increase risk of microcephaly in fetus expose to the virus .  The virus have be find in the fluid of pregnant mother and during autopsy in the brain of neonate with microcephaly ( 2 .  Much of the concern in the medium regard the teratogenicity of Zika virus infection have focus on brain finding of microcephaly .  However , a document in many case series , there be a variety of brain abnormality that can be find in fetus expose to intrauterine Zika virus infection ( 2 .
***** The evidence support the association of ZIKV infection with congenital microcephaly and fetal brain tissue damage be rapidly increase , and supply recent information about pathology , clinical medicine , epidemiology , mechanism and experimental study .  Introduction The Zika virus ( ZIKV ) be a mosquito-borne , single-stranded RNA , flavivirus that be closely relate to yellow fever virus ( YFV ) , Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) and dengue virus ( DENV ) .  In human population it be potentially transmit via sex ( heterosexual or homosexual transmission ) ( 4 ) , blood transfusion ( 5 ) , from mother to fetus and through direct contact ( 6 ) ( Figure 1 ) .  The most common laboratory test for Zika virus confirmation constitute both RNA and antibody detection in plasma , urine , amniotic fluid , conception product , autopsy and placental tissue ( 7 ) , cerebrospinal fluid , semen , saliva and breast milk , which confirm the above-mentioned route of transmission ( 8 ) .  Zika virus infection be transmit to human population via mosquito bite , blood transfusion , sexual intercourse , and from mother to fetus .  The possible etiology may include environmental or genetic factor during pregnancy , such a , perinatal brain injury , craniosynostosis , drug , hypertensive disorder , intrauterine infection cause by West Nile virus ( WNV ) , and Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) ( 9 ) , and other prenatal viral infection e .  During the Zika virus pandemic in the French Polynesia , an unexpected rise in the number of autoimmune and neurological complication be observe .  In the Brazilian state , Bahia , multiple case of acute rash be follow by increased number of microcephalic fetus ( 13 ) , while in Pernambuco , almost 2 % of all the symptomatic and asymptomatic mother be suspect to be diagnose with microcephalic fetus .  Only half of the report case be far confirm by the presence of calcification , other brain malformation , or both ( 23 ) .  A retrospective review ( March 2014May 2015 ) , be conduct to identify ZIKV related brain abnormality in French Polynesian neonate .  It be report that 8 out of 19 identified case have severe microcephaly with major brain lesion , five have visible malformation and cerebral dysfunction , while six have brain lesion without microcephaly .
***** Zika ’ s calamitous attack on the brain of baby — a see from the inside .  A study of brain scan and ultrasound picture of 45 Brazilian baby whose mother be infect with Zika in pregnancy show that the virus can inflict serious damage to many different part of the fetal brain beyond microcephaly , the condition of unusually small head that have become the sinister signature of Zika .  Because some of the damage be see in brain area that continue to develop after birth , it may be that baby bear without obvious impairment will experience problem a they grow .

Recently , dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and anomaly of the brain vasculature have unexpectedly emerge a potential cause at the origin of behavioral abnormality and psychiatric disorder consequent to prenatal and perinatal infection .  This review aim to discuss the up-to-date literature evidence point to the neurovascular unit and brain vasculature damage a the etiological mechanism in neurodevelopmental syndrome .  While the latter can directly cause a congenital fetal infection , all the above condition pose a threat to the health of both the mother and the fetus through the action of immune factor .  Together , these find indicate that the physiological role of cytokine and immune factor in the government of brain development be likely to be disrupt upon stress and maternal immune response .  Of note , MIA have prove the non-necessity of congenital infection , of which there be limited evidence for influenza virus infection [ [ 19 ] ] .  The latter be mostly due to the so-called ‘ TORCH ’ pathogens , a cluster of microbe that include Toxoplasma gondii , rubella virus , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , and herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) , know for their different ability to directly infect the fetus during gestation [ [ 20 , 21 ] ] .

***** 44 References1208 Citing ArticlesRelated Articles SummaryThe Zika virus have spread rapidly in the Americas since it first identification in Brazil in early 2015 .  Prenatal Zika virus infection have be link to adverse pregnancy and birth outcome , most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomaly .  To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy cause these adverse outcome , we evaluate available data use criterion that have be propose for the assessment of potential teratogen .  On the basis of this review , we conclude that a causal relationship exist between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomaly .  Evidence that be use to support this causal relationship include Zika virus infection at time during prenatal development that be consistent with the defect observe ; a specific , rare phenotype involve microcephaly and associate brain anomaly in fetus or infant with presumed or confirm congenital Zika virus infection ; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility , include the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetus and infant .  Given the recognition of this causal relationship , we need to intensify our effort toward the prevention of adverse outcome cause by congenital Zika virus infection .  However , many question that be critical to our prevention effort remain , include the spectrum of defect cause by prenatal Zika virus infection , the degree of relative and absolute risk of adverse outcome among fetus whose mother be infect at different time during pregnancy , and factor that might affect a woman ’ s risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcome .  Addressing these question will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effect of Zika virus infection during pregnancy .  An increase in the number of infant with microcephaly in Brazil be first note in September 2015 , after the recognition of Zika virus transmission in the country earlier in the year1 ; this be follow by the recognition of a similar increase in French Polynesia after an outbreak there in 2013 and 2014 .

The New England Journal of Medicine have rush publication of the report , which add a big piece to the puzzle of whether and how the epidemic of Zika virus have cause a match surge in birth defect in Brazil .  The case provide the element need to virtually catch the virus in the act .  A pregnant woman with a Zika-like illness who be live in Brazil , a develop fetus that suddenly stop grow , clear brain damage in the fetus and , finally , the full genome of the virus find in the brain .  At the same time , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention release detail of it study of two newborn kill by microcephaly and two miscarriage in which evidence of Zika be find in the brain and placenta .  “ I think the actual isolation of the virus in the brain strengthen the thought that the Zika virus be cause these case of microcephaly .  `` The actual isolation of the virus in the brain strengthen the thought that the Zika virus be cause these case of microcephaly .  There be many area of dead and calcified brain tissue .  And the researcher find Zika virus in the brain of the fetus — not just trace , but the entire genome of the virus .
***** Doctors use MRIs and blood test to watch , in nearly real time , a the Zika virus destroy the brain of a fetus whose mother have be infect during a vacation in Latin America .

***** 00014-16 Volume 29 , Number 3July 2016SUMMARYThe rapid spread of the Zika virus ( ZIKV ) in the Americas and it potential association with thousand of suspected case of microcephaly in Brazil and high rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome meet the condition for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern , a state by the World Health Organization in February 2016 .  Two month later , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) announce that the current available evidence support the existence of a causal relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomaly .  Despite the grow number of case with maternal sign of infection and/or presence of ZIKV in tissue of affected newborn or fetus , it be currently difficult to assess the magnitude of increase of microcephaly prevalence in Brazil , as well a the role of other factor in the development of congenital neurological condition .  Analogous to dengue virus ( DENV ) epidemic , ZIKV have the potential to become endemic in all country infest by Aedes mosquito , while new mutation could impact viral replication in human , lead to increase virulence and consequently heighten chance of viral transmission to additional naive mosquito vector .  INTRODUCTIONEarly in 2015 , an outbreak of Zika virus ( ZIKV ) , a Flavivirus transmit by Aedes mosquito , be observe in northeast Brazil ( 1 .  In addition to the temporal association , the virus have be detect in case of diagnosed microcephaly in the amniotic fluid obtain by ultrasound-guided amniocentesis ( 11 ) , as well a in tissue of newborn that die shortly after birth or follow termination of pregnancy ( 8 , 12 ) .  In April 2016 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) announce that the available evidence support the existence of a causal relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomaly ( 16 ) .  OFC measurement be consider to correlate to brain size and reflect brain development .  EtiologyMicrocephaly can be cause by several factor lead to brain injury .  The majority of neuron be generate prior to 21 week gestation ; nevertheless , significant brain development occur afterwards through myelination and dendritic connection , explain why both pre- and postnatal brain injury can lead to microcephaly ( 28 ) .

The initial phase of the recovery , which occur in the second half of 2009 and in early 2010 , be in large part attributable to the stabilization of the financial system , the effect of expansionary monetary and fiscal policy , and the strong boost to production from business rebuild their depleted inventory .  In particular , over the past two year , the Federal Reserve have far ease monetary condition by purchase longer-term security , specifically Treasury Agency and agency mortgage-backed security on the open market .  Although large-scale purchase of longer-term security be a different monetary policy tool than the more familiar approach of target the Federal Funds Rate , the two type of policy affect the economy in similar way .  By comparison , the Federal Reserve 's purchase of longer- term security do not affect very short-term interest rate , which remain close to zero , but instead put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rate .  Indeed a wide range of market indicator suggest that the Federal Reserve security purchase have be effective at ease financial condition , lend credence to the view that these action be provide significant support to job creation and economic growth .  If necessary , we could also tighten policy by redeem or sell security .  As I be appear before the Budget Committee , it be worth emphasize that the Fed 's purchase of longer-term security be not comparable to ordinary government spending .
***** Consider the future of privacy in a broad social context .  Governments and industry have very little incentive to reverse the already quite-invasive status quo while they have much to gain from ongoing loss of civil right in regard to individual privacy and data ownership ; people already seem to accept subversion of privacy a an inevitable fact of online life , a an expect tradeoff for something of value ; there ’ s no way the world ’ s vary culture , with their different view about privacy , will be able to come to an agreement on how to address civil liberty issue on the global Internet ; the situation will worsen a the Internet of Things arises and people ’ s home , workplace , and the object around them will “ tattle ” on them ; some community might plan and gain some acceptance for privacy structure , but the constellation of economic and security complexity be get big and hard to manage .  Citizens and consumer will have more control thanks to new tool that give them the power to negotiate with corporation and work around government ; individual will be able to choose to share personal information in a tiered approach that offer varied level of protection and access by others ; a backlash against privacy invasion in people ’ s digital life will inspire the structuring of a new equilibrium between consumer , government , and business ; more-savvy citizen will get good at hide thing they don ’ t want others to see .  ” Alex Halavais , an associate professor of social and behavioral science at Arizona State University , predict , “ There will be multiple such infrastructure within small community , but nothing even approach broad acceptance .  ” Alice Marwick , researcher of the social and cultural impact of social medium and author of Status Update .  ” danah boyd , a research scientist for Microsoft , respond , “ What you ’ re suggest sound like a fantasy , but I expect that the dynamic of security and privacy be go to be a bloody mess for the next decade , mire in ugly politics and corporate greed .  There will be a broad expectation of privacy unless social norm be violate in an obvious way , in which case , the offender will be rapidly track down and sanction .  For too many large nation a tension exist between state security and privacy right .  It be highly unlikely that nation state will forswear invasion of individual privacy right for national security purpose .

***** I want to welcome everyone here to this morning 's hearing , where we will discuss a major piece of the tax reform puzzle .  Today will be talk about idea , proposal , and consideration for reform the individual tax system .  While we have have countless hear on tax reform in recent year , today 's hearing be the first in what I hope will be a series of hear lead up to an intensive effort of this committee to draft and report comprehensive tax reform legislation .  In fact , since I become the lead Republican on this committee in 2011 , we have have more than 60 hearing where tax reform be the main focus of the discussion .  I would like to make a couple of point about that process for a moment , because there seem to be some confusion a to what the Finance Committee 's role will be in tax reform .  I have hear a lot of talk about a secret tax reform bill or a comprehensive plan be write behind closed door .  Most of you have probably also hear about tax reform detail that be set to be release later this month .  But a we state in our joint statement before the recess , and a I have state on numerous occasion , the tax write committee will be task with write the bill .  That take at least 14 vote , and hopefully we will get more .  If a bill -- particularly on something a consequential a tax reform -- be go to pass in this committee , the member of the committee will have to be involve in put it together .  Therefore , I intend to work closely with my colleague and let them express their preference and concern so that when we be ready to mark up a tax reform bill , the mark will reflect the consensus view of this committee .  While I can not see into the heart of every member of the Congress , I truly do not know of a single Republican who , when think about tax reform , ask themselves what they can do to help rich people .  It be important to recognize that the value of the current tax benefit of own a home , include both the MID and the property tax deduction , be embed in the price of a home .
