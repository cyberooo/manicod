Jacques Barzun One can fool all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but one can not fool all the people all the time when the evidence be a clear a it can be in natural science .  That science now have inadequate answer in some area do not mean that the answer will not become adequate in the future ; in fact , history teach that science 's answer become good and good a time go by .  And that science have no direct answer on matter of human purpose do not mean that it answer on other matter have no bearing on how , and how well , we be able to think about human purpose , free will , and other such thing .  Just a those who benefit from individual therapy can take pride from the persistent act of will they exert along the way , so humankind can take collective pride from the persistent determination to submit to reality therapy that have produce not only the science we now know but also an understanding of how to go about learn more .

The author proceed logically from premise which many people accept to a conclusion that many of those people would reject .  Of course , many people will argue that on this basis abortion should be recriminalised .  ” “ It seem to me if good people be not go to stand up to do away with people who believe in do away with live baby , then it mean no one be good , and it ’ s just easy for God to drop a couple asteroid on earth .  I know these people be murderer in their heart .  ” “ I have to say that I would personally kill anyone do a after-birth abortion if I have the chance .  Not that people would give argument in favour of infanticide , but the deep opposition that exist now to liberal value and fanatical opposition to any kind of reasoned engagement .

***** It ’ s almost erode our core value or threaten to erode our core value , and it ’ s do by a small , very dedicated group of people .  And , similarly , you know , this kind of fascism , communism , racism , and secularism , in all these case , there be a small group of people who always paint themselves a savior of the people , and always defend against a perceived external threat .  And why I ’ m say this , a a backdrop , be because , you know , these group tend to target always the other , the minority .  And , of course , the reputation damage to Islam in the medium and how it impact public perception of Muslims , of the community , be rat the high .  And , you know , we weren ’ t surprise , but the respondent say that they desire more community engagement or community-led efforts—you know , tailor specifically to that community—as the high , and second-rated be diplomacy , and follow by foreign policy .  And there be , of course , some skepticism surround the effectiveness of current response to extremism , which be not community-based .  And I say this holistically because past effort have entirely focus on the kinetics approach—military engagement , intel , homeland security—and have entirely ignore the role of ideology .  And when I say ideology , I mean that which be a motivating framework for how extremist group operate .  So that be why we focus our effort in “ WISE Up ” to really go inside ISIS and to actually see what be they do , how be they operate , how be they distort our religion—which , you know , be practice by 1 .

It be Passage through the Garden that prompt me to ask if anyone have write about Lewis and Clark and native people .  Throughout the 1970s the ethnohistory I write described native people , Christian missionary , and the change sweep throughout the colonial Northeast .  As the senior editor at the University of Illinois Press and later a find editor of the George Washington Papers at the University of Virginia , he never have student .  Rereading them now I can see Don cajole and correct me , keep me on the trail , and remind me not to lose track of the narrative line .  If the dedication page have not be promise to someone else , it surely would have go to Don .  What have always be see through the eye of Lewis and Clark need to be experience through the eye of native people .  Challenged by Jackson 's word and our correspondence , I go in search of an even large cast , one that act on a stage that stretch up the Missouri , across the mountain , down the Columbia , and on to the shore of the Pacific .  Again and again Corps of Discovery journal keeper record what native people tell them about everything from plant and animal to geography and relation with tribal neighbor .  Most who write about the expedition now acknowledge that native people be at the heart of the enterprise .  Some two decade later I would have say some thing more forcefully .

Of course , the fate of every successful specie be to wipe itself out .  humanus corporis , the body louse , must not be especially old , because it need for clothing meant that it could not have exist while human go naked .

***** Its actually strange to ask non-Christians to hold Christian value As the Barna Group have point out , a grow number of people in America be best describe a post-Christian .

Why would we expect people who don ’ t profess to be Christians to .  Click To Tweet Most people today be not pretend to be Christians .

Knowledge will forever govern ignorance , and a people who mean to be their own Governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge give .  This landmark law establish the principle that the record of a President relate to his official duty belong to the American people .  However , the release of those record have be delay while the current administration develop new procedure to handle possible claim of `` executive privilege `` that might be make by former President Reagan or his representative , or by President Bush or his representative .  I appreciate the need to preserve whatever constitutional privilege may still be appropriate for a former President 's record after many year .  However , I be concern that the new procedure may create additional delay and barrier to release the Reagan record .  If disclosure might impair national security , law enforcement , or the deliberative process of the executive branch .  In a nutshell , law enforcement be drop , so we go from three to two , and two area be add , so it go from two to four .  This new order undercut the public 's right to be fully inform about how this government , the people 's government , operate in the past .

***** Limiting Abortion Access Contributes to Poor Maternal Health Outcomes Abortion restriction and threat to access to comprehensive reproductive health care could be contribute toward the maternal mortality crisis in the United States .  Advancing Racial Equity and Justice , Strengthening Public Health and Ending the Pandemic , Health , Health Care , Maternal and Infant Health , Women , Womens Health and Rights , Womens Issues Access to abortion be a key component of woman ’ s comprehensive health care .  The ability to choose if , when , and how to give birth be link to woman ’ s economic success , educational attainment , and general health and well-being .  1 Anti-choice advocate , unfortunately , often use woman ’ s health and maternal mortality a justification for abortion restriction .  2 Although abortion have be prove to be one of the safe medical procedure , anti-choice policymakers at state and federal level continue to use the guise of protect woman ’ s health to promote restriction on abortion provider and procedure such a medication abortion ; add requirement for woman to fulfill in order to receive an abortion ; and limit the procedure after an arbitrary number of week into a pregnancy .  3 Research show , however , an inverse relationship between abortion restriction and both maternal and child health outcome and the number of policy intend to support woman and child ’ s well-being , include Medicaid expansion and protection for pregnant worker , among others .  4 Additionally , persistent structural racism play a significant role in the connection between abortion restriction and maternal mortality .  16 Unsafe abortion be uncommon in the United States , but with the increase in policy that restrict access to reproductive health care—including state-based abortion restriction , the restructure of Title X family plan clinic to distribute more funding toward crisis pregnancy center rather than clinic that provide comprehensive information , and policy that reduce access to affordable contraception—there be a chance that the number of abortion-related death may rise .

The Hyde Amendment , in effect since 1977 , essentially ban federal dollar from be use for abortion coverage for woman insure by Medicaid , the nation ’ s main public health insurance program for low-income Americans .  Women who be low-income and lack insurance coverage for abortion often struggle to come up with the money to pay for the procedure .  As a result , they often experience delay obtain an abortion or be force to carry their unintended pregnancy to term .  Supporters of abortion right have coalesce behind several state- and national-level initiative that aim to end the Hyde Amendment , so that the nation ’ s poor woman have great access to safe and legal abortion care .  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stumble into it when he say in a TV interview that if abortion be make illegal , woman seek one should be criminally punished—a statement that he later try to reframe with a more formal announcement that he be “ prolife with exception .  ” 1 Meanwhile , Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both call for expand access to abortion by end the Hyde Amendment .  Henry Hyde ( R-IL ) , be in many way the grandfather of all abortion restriction .

***** American Medical Association Abstract Crisis pregnancy center be organization that seek to intercept woman with unintended pregnancy who might be consider abortion .  Their mission be to prevent abortion by persuade woman that adoption or parent be a good option .  Although crisis pregnancy center enjoy First Amendment right protection , their propagation of misinformation should be regard a an ethical violation that undermines woman ’ s health .  CPCs , sometimes know a “ pregnancy resource center , ” “ pregnancy care center , ” “ pregnancy support center , ” or simply “ pregnancy center , ” be organization that seek to intercept woman with unintended or “ crisis ” pregnancy who might be consider abortion .  Their mission be typically to prevent abortion by persuade woman that adoption or parent be a good option [ 1 , 2 ] .  With an estimated 1,969 network-affiliated CPCs in the US in 2010 [ 1 ] , CPCs outnumber abortion clinic , which be estimate at 327 a of 2011 [ 5 ] .  Many state government fund CPCs through mechanism such a “ Choose Life ” specialty license plate and grant , and many also receive federal funding [ 3 , 6 ] .  We will first highlight the discrepancy between the lack of standard for quality of care provide by CPCs and the innumerable restriction on abortion clinic .

***** Wade , abortion have be squarely in the middle of political debate at the national and state level .  Soon after the Court ’ s ruling , Congress enact the Hyde Amendment , which block federal fund from be use to pay for abortion outside of the exception for rape , incest , or if the pregnancy be determine to endanger the woman ’ s life , result in dramatically limited coverage of abortion under Medicaid and other federal program .  1 Since it be first enact over 40 year ago , the amendment have be sponsor and support by legislator who oppose abortion and , in particular , object to the federal government ’ s use of taxpayer money for abortion service .  While abortion policy have be a hotly contest issue in most presidential election , the Hyde Amendment be not the focus of these debate until the 2016 election .  This brief detail the federal program that be affect by the Hyde Amendment and law and regulation that have a similar goal , provide estimate on the share of woman insure by Medicaid affect by the law , review the impact of the law on their access to abortion service , and discuss the potential effect if the law be to be repeal .  Initially , the Hyde Amendment only affect fund for abortion under Medicaid , a state and federal health program for low-income individual .  Because Congress reauthorizes the Hyde Amendment annually a an attachment to the appropriation bill for HHS , it also restrict abortion fund under the Indian Health Service , Medicare , and the Children ’ s Health Insurance Program .  The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) also include a provision that apply similar abortion coverage limitation to plan that be sell through the Marketplace for woman who receive federal income-based subsidy to purchase private health insurance .  9 For woman with medically complicate health situation or who need a second-trimester abortion , the cost could be prohibitive .

***** Restrictions on women�s access to safe abortion be not limit to Mexico .  Even in the United States , where abortion be legal , service be not readily accessible .  In fact , many woman and girl face serious legal or financial obstacle to access safe abortion service because of burdensome regulation , lack of provider , insufficient funding , or political opposition .  Obstacles to safe abortion in the United States seem to be on the rise .  Wade in 1973 , which establish women�s right to decide with regard to abortion a a matter of privacy , both state and federal legislator have limit access to legal abortion .  curtail women�s access to legal abortion ( such a through mandatory wait period or mandatory�and at time manifestly inaccurate�counseling ) ; or limit legal access to abortion to certain population ( such a rape victim or woman whose life be endanger by their pregnancy ) .  Women with limited economic resource face additional obstacle to safe abortion , result particularly in discrimination against woman who may already be marginalize .  While a wait period before a medical procedure may not in and of itself be incompatible with the right to health , it can create additional , and potentially unduly burdensome , barrier to access to safe and legal abortion .
***** Abortion Access in Georgia Read below to learn more about the hurdle Georgians face when seek abortion care .  Maternal mortality rate in Georgia be increase and be high among Black mother .  The late data show that 41 % of pregnancy in Georgia be want later or unwanted .  4 Yet , ~30 % of high school in Georgia do not teach about method of contraception other than condom , and less than one-third of high school teach all of the sexual health topic recommend by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .  Access to Abortion Clinics Only 28 facility provide abortion and just 17 of those be clinic .  As of 2014 , 96 % of Georgia ’ s county have no clinic that provide abortion , and 58 % of the state ’ s female population live in those county .  Multiple study have find that Georgia CPC service do not adhere to national recommendation for provide quality family planning service and high level of inaccurate and misleading health information on Georgia CPC website , which could pose risk .
***** Uneven Progress and Unequal Access provide the most current information on the incidence of abortion and unintended pregnancy worldwide , as well a trend since 1990 , a woman and couple increasingly want small family .  It examine law that regulate abortion and how they have evolve , and the current safety of abortion provision .  It document the barrier woman face to prevent unintended pregnancy and obtain safe abortion , and the impact of unsafe abortion on woman ’ s well-being .  This study provide a comprehensive update to find from the 2009 Abortion Worldwide .  Executive Summary The situation of induced abortion have change markedly over the past few decade .  This report provide update information on the incidence of abortion worldwide , the law that regulate abortion and the safety of it provision .  It also look at unintended pregnancy , it relationship to abortion , and the impact that both have on woman and couple who increasingly want small family and more control over the timing of their birth .  2014 , an estimate 36 abortion occur each year per 1,000 woman age 15 .  The abortion rate decline significantly in develop region since 1990 .  By far , the steep decline in abortion rate occur in Eastern Europe , where use of effective contraceptive increase dramatically ; the abortion rate also decline significantly in the develop subregion of Central Asia .  Both subregions be make up of former Soviet Bloc state where the availability of modern contraceptive increase sharply after political independence—exemplifying how abortion go down when use of effective contraceptive go up .  Although legality be the first step toward safe abortion , legal reform be not enough in itself .  Highly restrictive law do not eliminate the practice of abortion , but make those that do occur more likely to be unsafe .  In some setting , for example , woman may legally qualify for an abortion , but have no real access to safe service ; in others , safe procedure may be widely available , despite severe legal restriction .
***** Research suggest that be able to make decision about one ’ s own reproductive life and the timing of one ’ s entry into parenthood be associate with great relationship stability and satisfaction ( National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy 2008 ) , more work experience among woman ( Buckles 2008 ) , and increase wage and average career earnings ( Miller 2011 ) .  Given that a postsecondary degree considerably increase earnings ( Gault , Reichlin , and Román 2014 ) , the ability to make family planning choice could mean the difference between woman be stick at poverty-level wage or achieve long-term financial security .  In recent year , policy affect woman ’ s reproductive right in the United States have substantially change at both the federal and state level .  The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) increase access to preventive woman ’ s health service and contraceptive method and counsel for million of woman ( Burke and Simmons 2014 ) , and facilitate state ’ ability to expand Medicaid family planning service .  At the same time , legal limitation to woman ’ s reproductive right have increase in state across the country , make it hard for woman to access the reproductive health service and information they need ( Guttmacher Institute 2015a ; NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation 2015 ) .  In the first quarter of 2015 alone , state legislator introduce a total of 332 provision to restrict access to abortion service ; by April 2015 , 53 of these provision have be approve by a legislative chamber and nine have be enact ( Guttmacher Institute 2015a ) .  This report provide information on a range of policy relate to woman ’ s reproductive health and right .  It examine abortion , contraception , the access of individual in same-sex couple to full parental right , infertility , and sex education .  It also present data on fertility and natality—including infant mortality—and highlight disparity in woman ’ s reproductive right by race and ethnicity .
***** ( Photo by Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images ) According to the Guttmacher Institute , roughly 75 percent of those who get abortion be poor or low-income — not necessarily a surprise , give the lack of access to affordable preventative health care and contraception .  But for low-income patient — especially in rural area across the country — find the fund to pay for an abortion out of pocket be quite literally only half the battle .  Nearly 20 percent of poor people lack their own vehicle , and the same state that pas paternalistic abortion restriction be also the state least likely to spend infrastructure fund dollar on mass transit , consider it a form of “ social welfare ” for those too poor to own car .  Get Talk Poverty In Your Inbox The limited number of abortion clinic — often pair with face to face wait period that be anywhere from one to three day apart — and the shortage of transportation infrastructure mean that low-income patient without a car be often force to hire taxi and other car service , rent vehicle , or navigate an expensive bus or train schedule at a time when they be emotionally and in some case physically vulnerable , too .  “ I didn ’ t even know you could go that far .  Abortion fund — organization that offer financial support for those seek out a pregnancy termination — can offer gas card , but that still require patient to have a car to begin with .  Amanda Reyes , co-founder of the Yellowhammer Fund , an abortion funding and practical support group for pregnant people in Alabama , say for patient outside a city — even just in the exurbs of the city that do have clinic — rent a car be often the only solution .  But for people who be low income and lack not only the fund for rent but also the credit card , debit card , or check account need to rent a car in the first place — about 20 percent of Americans be consider “ unbanked or underbanked ” — this can be nearly impossible .
***** > The macroeconomics of abortion .  > The macroeconomics of abortion .  A scoping review and analysis of the cost and outcome Background Although abortion be a common gynecological procedure around the globe , we lack synthesis of the know macroeconomic cost and outcome of abortion care and abortion policy .  This scoping review synthesize the literature on the impact of abortion-related care and abortion policy on economic outcome at the macroeconomic level ( that be , for society and nation state ) .  For inclusion , study must have examine one of the following macroeconomic outcome .  cost , impact , benefit , and/or value of abortion care or abortion policy .  Findings show that post-abortion care service can constitute a substantial portion of national expenditure on health .  Public sector coverage of abortion cost be sparse , and individual bear most of the cost .  Evidence also indicate that liberalize abortion law can have positive spillover effect for woman ’ s educational attainment and labor supply , and that access to abortion service contribute to improvement in child ’ s human capital .  However , the political economy around abortion legislation remain complicate and controversial .  Conclusions Given the highly charge political nature of abortion around the global and the preponderance of rhetoric that can cloud reality in policy dialogue , it be imperative that social science researcher build the evidence base on the macroeconomic outcome of abortion service and regulation .
***** With this work , I recognize that within society there be a split between those who support a woman ’ s choice to have an abortion , and those who do not .  I argue that both the decision , to have an abortion , as well a to carry a pregnancy to term , have consequence .  For this reason , access to safe , medical care regard reproduction and abortion should be available to all woman , across all state .  Initially , I will establish the foundational background on the legalization of abortion .  It will begin in the early 1800s , a time where abortion before “ quicken ” be legal for woman in the United States .  However , a woman begin to die from abortion induce drug , and Dr .  Horatio Storer team with the American Medical Association to begin the “ crusade on abortion , ” disdain for the procedure grow .  Throughout the mid-to-late 1800s , state begin pa legislation to ban the drug use for abortion and , eventually , the procedure itself .  The second section of this work delve into the state barrier put on abortion .  Although legal federally , state constitution still allow for each state to put law in place that restrict access to abortion , include zone law , mandatory counseling , mandatory wait period , and minor consent or notification .  In addition to these ongoing issue in state , the current President propose a domestic gag rule , and reinstate a global gag rule , that limit funding to abortion provider .

The idea be that know the US can obliterate a country no matter what , even if the US be attack with nuke itself , will prevent a country from ever try it .  That ’ s the idea that no country would nuke the United States first if it know America would be able to launch a devastating response .  make sure other country can be certain that the US will be able to nuke them back no matter what .  The idea of Russia or China launch a nuke at the US right now for no reason other than they think they could get away with it because of Pelosi ’ s comment may seem far-fetched — and it be .  There ’ s no evidence whatsoever to suggest any country have a plan or desire to start a nuclear war with the United States in the next two week .

***** Making the decision to go to war of any sort be a heavy responsibility for our Nation 's elected leader , and the decision to use nuclear weapon be the most consequential of all .  As President Truman say , `` You have get to understand that this be n't a military weapon .  Given today 's challenge , we need to revisit this question on whether a single individual should have the sole and unchecked authority to launch a nuclear attack under all circumstance , include the right to use it a a first strike .  At the outset , I must say that the view I express this morning be mine .  So there be limit on what I can say , even if some aspect of this matter be discuss openly by others .  Russia frequently make explicit nuclear threat to include the threat of nuclear first use .  First , it be design to enable the authorized use of nuclear weapon while prevent the unauthorized use or the accidental use or the inadvertent use of them ; and two , to do so in the face of a wide variety of scenario , include a nuclear attack .  A colleague and mentor of mine have always say that when you be look at an adversary , you have to look at capability and intent .  The nuclear decision process include assessment , review , and consultation between the President and key civilian and military leader follow by transmission and implementation of any presidential decision by the force themselves .  Russia 's and North Korea 's explicit nuclear threat ( to include the threat of nuclear first-use ) remind u that nuclear weapon be not go , and it appear they will not be eliminate from world affair anytime soon .  The process include `` assessment , review , and consultation ( via ) secure phone and video conferencing to enable the President to consult with his senior advisor , include the Secretary of Defense and other military commander .

China also have continue to develop hypersonic weapon , include stand-off “ carrier killer , ” space weapon and cyber capability to blind opponent ’ strategic and conventional system .
***** They have , he say later , `` sniff imperiously at the goal of elimination , air their stock Cold War rhetoric , hurl a personal epithet or two and settle smugly back into their world of exaggerated threat and bygone enemy `` .  Since then the world have come perilously close to nuclear war a number of time and the risk of accidental war have be draw attention to not just by the peacenik but by such illustrious Cold War warrior a senior arm advisor to President Ronald Reagan , Fred Ikle and Paul Nitze .

Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent.
***** The committee grant my request to have a hearing today about FHA eligibility here in Chino Hills because of the concern raise by resident about the high voltage transmission tower and power line structure be erect within the utility right-of-way , but in close proximity to many home here in Chino Hills .  In addition , they have raise concern about whether the Federal Housing Administration would allow FHA financing for their home a a result of proximity to the new transmission tower to their home .  We be also concern about the impact on the fund if home value in the neighborhood go down because FHA be not available to other community on this option .  They will give u understand from industry professional about the impact on FHA 's insurance fund if the State mandate cause home value to decrease , a many resident be concern about .  That mean there be 4,000 people who be within 500 foot of this project , and the property value , a a result , have suffer in this area .  He have be an instructor and an appraiser of real estate for property tax purpose and have testify in the capacity of an expert witness in State and Federal court hearing .  A high voltage power line propose in California must go through a transmission planning process whereby the California Independent System Operator , also know a CAISO , must analyze the cost-effectiveness and impact on grid reliability of the propose line .
***** In a residential context EMFs can be create by proximity to external source such a power line , substation , transformer , mobile phone mast and electrify rail track .  Public perception be therefore likely to lead to market resistance and , combine with the visual impact in many case , may influence market value where property be in EMF proximity .  Exposure level depend on proximity and duration to the EMF source .
***** There be a few reported incidence of people get electrocute to death by low-hanging line .  High wind and fall object may also bring down power line .
***** Those utility company necessity might allow you to buy the house for less money than a comparable dwell away from power line , but they can also affect your resale value .  One example point to a Rhode Island group , the Friends of India Point Park , which have be try to have the high-voltage power line in their area move underground .
***** A wide area synchronous grid , also know a an `` interconnection `` in North America , directly connect many generator deliver AC power with the same relative frequency to many consumer .  4 Wireless power transmission 18 Security of control system 19 Records 20 See also 21 References 22 Further reading System [ edit ] Most transmission line be high-voltage three-phase alternate current ( AC ) , although single phase AC be sometimes use in railway electrification system .  HVDC technology be also use in submarine power cable ( typically long than 30 mile ( 50 km ) ) , and in the interchange of power between grid that be not mutually synchronize .  Undergrounding Electric power can also be transmit by underground power cable instead of overhead power line .  These company continue to develop AC system but the technical difference between direct and alternate current system would follow a much longer technical merger .
***** The study focus on the value of vacant land , eliminate other factor that could also influence price , such a home style and square footage .  The researcher say land typically represent 20 percent of a home ’ s overall value .
***** The study that find a link between power line and property value also find that the effect get small over time .  In a brand-new neighborhood in which power line may be the most prominent feature -- and in which there be more home for sale -- potential buyer look at the wire and say , `` No way I 'm go to live by those .
***** In most States , underground power connection be compulsory in newly develop out suburban subdivision , but in general it can be say that there be little political will to do more .  Around 850 distribution transformer be also put out of service , a be 310 section of high voltage distribution line and 430 street main .  It choose not to impose charge on property owner because of possible conflict between those who agree to pay and those who do not .  Supporters of underground cable there say that no cognisance be take of aesthetic or social value , and that because of high initial cost there be no public pressure to begin even a modest program .
***** You may be able to get the house for cheap than those away from the power line , but that also mean it will affect the resale value .  That say , if you be a homeowner look to sell the house , do not worry a Aniya Equity be always look to buy house near power line .  However , let u look into how much power line decrease property value .
***** article We ’ ve all heard story about home be unsellable due to high-voltage power line exist in close proximity to the house .  But power line alone be simply one of many factor influence the overall value , and it ’ s impossible to accurately say exactly how much of a negative the power line will be .
***** We ’ ll break these health concern down shortly , but for now it ’ s worth note that no research have prove any solid link between the proximity to power line and medical issue .  While your resale value may be worth less than other home in the area , you ’ ll also spend less when it come time to buy the home .

***** It be an arm of the Federal Government , and it decision govern virtually every private workplace in the Nation .  I be concern that the Board have jettison this responsibility over the last 2 year in favor of an activist agenda design to advance the cause of big labor over the right of everyday worker .  We have a job to do , and it include oversee the various board , agency , and department within our jurisdiction to ensure that they do not undermine the strength of our workforce .  The board have remove bannering restriction previously place on boycott of neutral employer .  The board have also request brief that could allow even great access to an employer 's property .  In one case , the board move to uphold an election taint by intimidation of worker because the intimidation originate with `` nonparties `` to the election .  Although this be just one of many case present to the NLRB , we must remember the board do not operate in a vacuum .  It be an arm of the federal government , and it decision govern virtually every private workplace in the nation .  I be concern the board have jettison this responsibility over the last two year in favor of an activist agenda design to advance the cause of Big Labor over the right of every day worker .  We have a job to do and that include oversee the various board , agency , and department within our jurisdiction to ensure they do not undermine the strength of our workforce .  So here be a situation where there be pending litigation before an administrative law judge , where the general counsel of the NLRB have make a decision to pursue an argument in that forum , and that argument be be vigorously defend by the other side in that forum .

Print Comment `` This be the outcome we have always prefer , and one that be typical for our agency , `` say NLRB Acting General Counsel Lafe Solomon in a statement .  The NLRB have charge that Boeing decide to open the plant , which have about 1,000 employee , in order to punish the union for past strike that shut down the aircraft maker 's production line .

***** Boeing 's decision to move to South Carolina have turn into a legal nightmare - Charleston City Paper Since our founding in 1997 , the Charleston City Paper have be work hard every day to share the late in news , food , music , culture and cool stuff in and around the Holy City .  Posted inFeatures , News Boeing ’ s decision to move to South Carolina have turn into a legal nightmare Last week , South Carolina ’ s top politician gather together to celebrate the official opening of Boeing ’ s Dreamliner plant in North Charleston .

Prior to the announcement , Boeing have pursue plan to create a second plant in Everett , Wash .  The airline manufacturer ’ s original Dreamliner plant be still in operation , and it appear that Boeing have no intention of end operation there .  Since the announcement of the North Charleston plant , some 2,000 job have be create by Boeing in Washington .  The National Labor Relations Board have say that Boeing ’ s decision to build a new Dreamliner plant in the Palmetto State be tantamount to union busting .  And in a lawsuit file in April , the NLRB send a strong message to big business that the labor agency might be up it game when it come to pro-labor position .  “ The charge be that Boeing make the decision to locate this particular production line here rather than in Washington in order to punish the union and it worker for have strike in the past and in order to intimidate it with respect to strike in the future , ” he say .  “ The [ NLRB ’ s ] argument be that by make the public statement that Boeing make , what they do be indicate that the reason they be do this be to punish the worker for have do something they have the legal right to do , which be engage in strike , ” Wheeler say .  At the time , Haley say Catherine Templeton , the new director of the Department of Labor , Licensing and Regulation , would help her “ fight the union ” — specifically help to block union from organize at the Boeing plant .
***** The NLRB have accuse Boeing of open it South Carolina shop in a 'right-to-work ' state .  In a faltering economy , the aerospace titan open a $ 750 million factory in South Carolina and hire thousand of worker to build the world ’ s most fuel-efficient commercial jet .  a the New York Times describe it — a cause clbre among Republican lawmaker and 2012 hopeful , the National Labor Relations Board have accuse Boeing of open it South Carolina shop in a “ right-to-work ” state to retaliate against union worker strike at it main manufacture base in the Seattle area .  “ It ’ s like a lightning rod , ” say Gary Chaison , an industrial relation professor at Clark University in Worcester , Mass .  ” At the same time the president be sell his American Jobs Act in the Rose Garden last week , Mitt Romney be visit Boeing ’ s South Carolina factory .  The former governor of Massachusetts draw loud cheer for suggest that any stimulus package should include legislation tell the board to drop it complaint .  “ It ’ s an egregious example of political payback where the president be able to pay back the union for the hundred of million of dollar they have put into his campaign at the expense of American worker , ” Romney say .  As the New York Times explain , the case originate with an unfair labor charge file by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Engineers last year , declare that Boeing be illegally punish it Washington state member for exercise their right to strike .  As the Times have report , Boeing official deny violate any labor law , argue the main reason for choose South Carolina be to low production cost and that it have hire 5,000 union worker in Washington since the complaint be file .

GENE JOHNSON and SAM HANANEL , Associated Press SEATTLE - A contentious labor dispute between the government and Boeing Co .  that spawn a national political fight likely will be settle after the company and the Machinists union announce Wednesday they 'd reach a tentative deal on a new four-year collective bargaining agreement .  If the deal be finalize , it would appear to leave in place the work at a new $ 750 million Boeing plant in South Carolina , a right-to-work state where the company open a new production line for it 787 airplane .  The National Labor Relations Board file a lawsuit earlier this year allege that Boeing violate labor law by open the South Carolina line .  Acting on a complaint from the union , the agency claim that Boeing be punish Washington state worker for past strike and say the company should return the work to Washington .  Boeing have vigorously deny the charge , claim it open the South Carolina plant for valid economic reason .  , say Tom Wroblewski , president of Machinists Union District 751 .  Wroblewski say that if union member vote to approve the deal in the come week , the union would inform the NLRB that it have no further grievance with Boeing .
***** The agency ’ s act general counsel , Lafe Solomon , say it be illegal for company to take action in retaliation against worker for exercise the right to strike .  Although manufacturer have long move plant to nonunion state , the board note that Boeing official have , in internal document and news interview , specifically cite the strike and potential future strike a a reason for their 2009 decision to expand in South Carolina .  Boeing say it would “ vigorously contest ” the labor board ’ s complaint .  and Supreme Court precedent , ” say J .  Michael Luttig , a Boeing executive vice president and it general counsel .  ” It be highly unusual for the federal government to seek to reverse a corporate decision a important a the location of plant .  In October 2009 , Boeing say it would locate it second line at a new , nonunion plant in South Carolina .  “ Boeing ’ s decision to build a 787 assembly line in South Carolina send a message that Boeing worker would suffer financial harm for exercise their collective bargaining right , ” say the union ’ s vice president , Rich Michalski .  Boeing say on Wednesday that none of the production job in South Carolina have come at the expense of job in Washington .
***** retaliate against union worker by locate a plant in South Carolina .  for build a South Carolina assembly plant after a strike by Washington state worker hurt state ' ability to keep manufacturing job .  Nikki Haley have be hammer away at the issue and insist GOP presidential candidate do the same , and a California congressman say Wednesday he would bring a House oversight committee to South Carolina this month to focus on how the NLRB 's `` action against Boeing could impact the thousand of Boeing employee at a non-union worksite in South Carolina .  The NLRB want that work return to Washington state , even though the company have already build the new South Carolina plant - the large single industrial investment in the state 's history - and hire 1,000 worker .  Union advocate argue the NLRB be merely do it job of enforce the nation 's labor law .  Since the decision to open the South Carolina plant , the attorney general write , Boeing have actually add more than 2,000 union job in Washington state .
***** But more importantly , they 're design to protect the right of worker to make free and informed decision about whether they want to join a union .  A neutral arbiter be create to maintain the balance Congress establish in the law , protect worker free choice , and serve a an unbiased judge over labor dispute .  We have repeatedly see the Obama NLRB overturn longstanding labor policy and put in place new policy design to empower special interest .  It 's why the board adopt an ambush election rule that chill employer ' free choice and free speech , cripple worker free choice , and jeopardize the privacy of worker and their family .  It 's why the board endorse a new joint employer standard that will destroy job and make it hard for entrepreneur and small business to pursue the American dream .  It 's also why the board be advance a micro-union proposal that gerrymander the workplace , thereby limit the workplace mobility of employee and tie up employer in red tape .  Meanwhile , worker have less time to make informed decision in union election .  In the week and month ahead , we will do everything we can to turn back this failed activist agenda and restore balance and fairness to the board .  But more importantly , they be design to protect the right of worker to make free and informed decision about whether they want to join a union .  A neutral arbiter be create to maintain the balance Congress establish in the law , protect worker free choice , and serve a an unbiased judge over labor dispute .  We have repeatedly see the Obama NLRB overturn long-standing labor policy and put in place new policy design to empower special interest .
***** * President say foreign company afford unfair edge * Obama tout U .  Highlighting a major theme for his re-election campaign , Obama also tout a nascent resurgence in the American manufacturing sector during a stop at Boeing Co ’ s huge plant in Everett , Washington .  “ It look cool , ” Obama say , add that the plane be an example of the ability of U .  “ What ’ s happen here in Everett can happen in other industry , ” he say .  The National Labor Relations Board sue Boeing on behalf of unionized machinist over it decision to open a non-union 787 assembly line in South Carolina .
***** The 3rd Circuit 's decision follow an appeal by .  In 2010 , the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) say yes by issue a rule that require private employer subject to the National Labor Relations Act ( NLRA ) to post a notice advise employee of their right to unionize .  When Barack Obama be elect president , it be widely think that his administration would be the most `` labor-friendly `` in decade .  Ever since the National Labor Relations Board 's ( NLRB ) attempt a few year ago to prosecute Boeing for open a nonunion plant in South Carolina to build airplane it also build in it unionized Washington state plant , the Board have become an object of scorn in Congress and the court .
***** and the National Labor Relations Board clash Tuesday at a hearing on the board 's allegation that the aircraft maker illegally shift work from union plant in Washington state to a new non-union factory in South Carolina .  The hearing , which deal mostly with procedural issue , mark the start of what could be a lengthy and politically charged legal battle , unless Boeing and the company 's machinist union , whose complaint spark the board 's inquiry , settle their difference .
***** In another public demonstration of concern about the struggle economy , President Obama will meet in Pittsburgh on Tuesday with the business and labor leader he have choose to counsel him on job creation .  But many of the chief executive have cut American job and adopt tactic that weaken organize labor -- even a their business post record profit .  When he create the council , which also include two labor leader , a biologist and an economist , Obama say it member would assist him to “ do everything we can to spur hiring and ensure our nation can compete with anybody on the planet .  ” Advertisement Just day before the president appoint Kenneth I .  Xerox , whose chief executive , Ursula Burns , sit on the board , have cut 4,500 job in the first six month of 2011 .  ” Boeing be in the middle of a dispute with the National Labor Relations Board , which accuse the aircraft maker of move work from union factory in Washington state to a nonunion plant in South Carolina .  Boeing spokesman Tim Neale say the company add union job in Washington state after announce the decision to open a plant in South Carolina .
***** The Federalist Society seek to foster further discussion and debate about the status of labor law and labor relation in the United States .  However , despite President Obamas support for EFCA , for a number of reason organize labor be unable to overcome a threatened Senate filibuster in 2009 and 2010 , and EFCA become a dead letter when Republicans take the House and make significant gain in the Senate in the 2010 election .  The NLRBs attempt regulatory establishment of what opponent have label EFCA-lite have be accomplish by Board rulemaking , General Counsel action , and Board case decision .  Employers who fail to post the notice would be guilty of a new , Board-created unfair labor practice , could lose the protection of the Acts six-month statute of limitation , and could have that failure be consider a evidence against them in case involve other unfair labor practice .  It strike down the unfair labor practice penalty for not post only to the extent that the Board can not make a blanket advance determination that a failure to post will always constitute an unfair labor practice .  The court specifically rule that nothing in it decision prevent the Board from find that a failure to post constitutes an unfair labor practice in any individual case .  It similarly hold that the NLRB could consider an employer failure to post the notice a stop the running of the statute of limitation in individual case and a evidence of an employer unlawful motive in individual case allege an unfair labor practice other than failure to post .  district court rule that the Board could not make failure to post the notice a per se unfair labor practice .  Complaint Against Boeing for Locating New Plant in a Right-to-Work State In October 2009 , Boeing decide to open a new production line for it 787 Dreamliner at a plant in North Charleston , South Carolina , that it have early purchase from Vought Aircraft .  The public statement of Boeing official indicate that one factor in decide to open the second Dreamliner line in South Carolina , a right-to-work state , be repeat strike the union have conduct in Washington , a non-right-to-work state , and the IAMs refusal to add a no-strike clause to the collective-bargaining agreement .  The charge assert that Boeings decision to place the second production line in a nonunion facility constitute unlawful retaliation for past strike , and be intend to chill future strike activity , by it unionized Washington employee .  Its thrust be that Boeings decision to create new job in South Carolina be motivate by anti-union animus and , therefore , violate the NLRA .
***** It be open a a second location to build 787 Dreamliner jet after a series of union strike in Washington state plant .  Next , back in this country , a fight among government , labor and business over the location of a manufacturing plant .  But after a series of union strike in Washington State , the company decide to open it second 787 assembly line in North Charleston , South Carolina , a right-to-work state .  What be the agency charge be illegal about Boeing put this plant in South Carolina ? .  So , the National Labor Relations Board be assert that Boeing , in decide to open this plant in South Carolina , be illegally retaliate against worker in Seattle because they have exercise what the Labor Board say be their legal , their federally protect right to strike .  And the union up in Seattle have go on strike five time since 1977 , include a 58-day strike in 2008 , which Boeing say cost the company $ 1 .  So , when Boeing announce two year ago that it want to open up a new factory in South Carolina , some Boeing executive say , we 're tire of all these disruption .  And the Labor Board say you ca n't punish the worker in that way .  They say Boeing should have the right , like any company , to decide where it want to locate a plant , and federal bureaucrat should n't get in the way .  And then that agency , the Labor Board , decide to move forward with a case say that Boeing have act illegally .
***** Labor , Consumer Advocates Raise Concerns about Proposed Wireless Merger The propose merger of two of the nation large wireless carrier be draw opposition from labor and consumer advocate who warn that it will negatively impact market competition , consumer choice and price , job retention , and worker wage .  The commission say it will accept additional public comment on the new information until March 28 .  Catlin and other Walmart worker with disability garner national headline last month after their employer inform thousand of greeter that their job would be phase out in favor of a position with more physical demand , such a heavy lifting and stair climbing .  Amid Tight Job Market , Boeing Machinists Win Mid-Contract Pay Raises Thousands of unionized machinist at a Washington State Boeing plant have win a rare mid-contract pay raise to correct wage disparity implement by the company in response to a tight labor market .  Last year , after year of layoff and attrition , management respond to an acute labor shortage in some area by offer new hire wage that be high than stipulate in the contract , the Times report .  On March 4 , the Post and Courier of Charleston , South Carolina , report that former South Carolina governor and prominent organize labor critic Nikki Haley have be nominate for a seat on Boeings board of director .
***** The source of the saga be the Obama Boards 2011 decision in Specialty Healthcare , which open the floodgate on micro-units small bargain unit within a large facility of employee .  The decision be a boon for union , which be more effective organize small group of worker than gain majority support of an entire workforce .
More (student-athletes) graduate than the students who arent student-athletes.
***** Gerald Herbert/AP Photo What do it take to get a kid to stay in school and graduate ? .  New York City have experiment with pay student when they get good grade .  Angela Duckworth ’ s research focus on how personality trait like “ grit ” and perseverance help student persist through hardship at school .  A new study from the University of Kansas suggest that there ’ s a simpler , more universal way to motivate student .
***** “ The lack of academic integrity across college sport may be the most insidious piece of a broken system , ” Murphy write in the report that slam the deficient graduation rate of student-athletes a they compare to those of other student .  “ The NCAA ’ s primary response to my first report be that student be compensate , in their opinion .  They believe that scholarship be adequate compensation for all of the time student put in and all the money they make for the system , ” Murphy tell HuffPost .  “ But there be a lot of student who be in the big-time college program where school be treat them like commodity and not give them the education that they deserve .
***** If they do happen to graduate and dont go on to play professionally , all they have be a ticket out the door into the real world , fend for themselves by use only what they learn through sport for 4 year .  Besides a few general study course and a pat on the back , often time athlete arent get much of anything once they step out of school .
***** About 14 % of 10th grade student whose family be in the top 20 % in term of socioeconomic status play sport in college compare to few than 4 % of those in the bottom 20 % of socioeconomic status .  23 % of the most privileged student play college sport compare to 9 % of the least privileged student .  The result contradict the traditional story of how sport often help underprivileged kid succeed in American society , say James Tompsett , co-author of the study and graduate student in sociology at The Ohio State University .  A privilege background help student succeed in sport just a it do in other part of life .
***** Kat Tretina be a freelance writer who cover everything from student loan to personal loan to mortgage .  `` On the sideline of play field and exhibition hall , parent , student and coach have many dream beyond that day competition .  In reality , athletic scholarship often dont provide enough assistance to graduate with a debt-free degree .  Each year , hundred of thousand of student hope to get recruit for their sport skill , but only a very elite group will make the team and even few will get scholarship .
***** When you disaggregate that graduation data by race and by type of sport , you find that Black athletes in football and men ’ s basketball [ in the Power Five conference ] be graduate at rate around 55 percent .  As much a we like to say athlete go pro in thing other than sport , many of those in the revenue-producing sport be not well-positioned for competitive entry into the job marketplace or graduate school .  whether they graduate or not .
***** There be not enough black college athlete graduate .  5 percent of undergraduate student at the 65 Power Five school , but 56 .  Black male athlete graduate at a rate of 53 .  But they ’ re worth remember over the next three week while watch the NCAA Tournament a basketball player , who be predominantly black , aren ’ t allow to get pay and may or may not graduate .
***** For every 28 student , only one get a crack at play Division I sport , and only about one percent make it to the professional level .  But what about the rest of you — the majority of you — who want to nurture your love of the game but arent necessarily plan to go pro ? .
***** The debate about whether student athlete should be pay rear it head every year , with the most common argument make against do so point to the fact college-level sport be suppose to be an amateur enterprise .  In this light , be part of a sport team at college be see a part of the education student be pay their fee for , rather than a a job or a career .  It ’ s a common misconception that college athlete graduate debt-free or study on a full scholarship .
***** Some argue student-athletes be `` pay `` through full scholarship , something most college student can only dream about and that 's partially true .  , Football Bowl Subdivision ( formerly Division I-A ) football and Division I basketball for men , and Division I basketball , tennis , volleyball , and gymnastics for woman student receive full athletic scholarship cover tuition and fee , room and board , and book .  Everyone around them make money , but the student responsible for generate revenue receive nothing .  25 per hour for 35 hour a week would earn the student a little over $ 1,000 per month .
***** The National Collegiate Athletic Association like to boast that athlete graduate at rate high than non-athletes in some case , significantly high .  But the tool the NCAA use to make that assertion -- the Graduation Success Rate , or GSR -- follow a unique formula that factor out athlete who transfer in good academic standing , instead count them a graduate .  But the federal rate count only full-time , first-time student who graduate from the institution where they begin .  That mean that student who go part-time or take break bring down an institution 's graduation rate , again make it a less-than-ideal benchmark for comparison , give that all athlete ( unlike other student ) be require to maintain full course load .  Enter the Adjusted Graduation Gap , a model that compare athletes graduation rate by conference and sport directly to the rate of their non-athlete peer by factor out part-time student .  Instead of say , Well , athletes graduate at a rate thats well , instead of make just short sound bite , let look at the situation and say , Athletes from different sport be different .
***** The literal blood , sweat , and tear of student athlete fuel a $ 14 billion industry , but until very recently , those student receive little in return and be vulnerable to be toss aside .  “ The NCAA ’ s priority should be the success , safety and well-being of student athlete at college and university across the nation .  While the organization rake in billion of dollar off the back of their athlete , the student be expect to be content with crumb in comparison , ” Wyden say .  This new college student athletes bill of right be a step towards ensure safety , opportunity and accountability in college athletics .
***** On the opposite sideline there be coach , teacher and athlete who would argue that high school sport be a beneficial to student in the classroom a they be on the field of play .  Angela Lumpkin , professor of health , sport and exercise science , and Rebecca Achen , doctoral candidate and graduate teaching assistant at KU , show that athlete have high percentage of day of school attend , graduation rate , and Kansas assessment score and low dropout rate than nonathletes .  They analyze data for student in grade nine through 12 for the 2011-12 school year in school throughout the state .  Kansas have a policy that to be eligible to compete in sport , student must pass at least five credit hour per semester .  Lumpkin cite the policy a a reason many student persist in their academic work .
***** The problem with that argument be that college athlete aren ’ t able to fully actualize their identity a student to the same degree a their classmate .  They be student such a Jalen ( a pseudonym ) , a football player who request a meeting with me mid-semester .  Or be they student who play sport part-time ? .
***** A Gallup study of college graduate find that former athlete be more likely to be thrive in life after graduation , largely due to the support system their sport team provide for them .  College student who participate in athletics tend to fare good than nonathletes in their academic , personal and professional life during college and after graduation , a new Gallup study on alumnus outcomes find .  But in one category , financial well-being , former athlete and nonathletes who graduate in the last two decade report similar level of student loan debt , with about 20 percent of these graduate exceed $ 40,000 in debt , the study find .  The study be part of Gallups ongoing series examine survey of college graduate .
***** The academic success , campus involvement , and future goal of Division I student athlete who be university bound compare to those who would not have attend a university have they not be an athlete .  The academic success , campus involvement , and future goal of Division I student athlete who be university bound compare to those who would not have attend a university have they not be an athlete .  The academic success , campus involvement , and future goal of Division I student athlete who be university bound compare to those who would not have attend a university have they not be an athlete .  This study examine the difference between two group of Division I student athlete .  The researcher examine a number of academic factor include GPA , participation in intensive academic experience , class participation and preparation , perception of academic experience , importance of graduation , major selection , and participation in extracurricular activity , future goal , and identification a an athlete or student .  The data from the NCAA ’ s Growth , Opportunities , Aspirations and Learning of Students in College ( GOALS ) survey that be administer to a nationwide , random sample of NCAA student athlete in 2006 be discuss .  For example , our find suggest that student athlete who identify a athlete first and student second think less about academic when choose a college , be less likely to major in mathematics and science , be less likely to select a major to prepare for graduate school or a specific career , have low GPAs , be less likely to participate in class , be less likely to be involve in extracurricular activity , be less willing to sacrifice on athletics participation for academic , feel graduation be less important to them and to their family , and believe become a professional athlete be more likely .  Regardless of the reason why they be not university-bound in the first place , many of these student end up on university campus compete and attend class alongside other student athlete and non-athletes who be university-bound all along .
***** Member of the National Association For College Admissions Counseling PLAN FOR COLLEGE , PREPARE FOR LIFE `` No matter who they be , where they be or what their circumstance , we can help any student find a way forward .  It sound confusing , but Division III school be typically small private college , and they often give merit award for student accomplishment .  At this stage , parent should be make the initial contact , but eventually , student will need to take over in the recruitment process .  Of course , one might argue that for future pro athlete , student athletics function much like an internship might , but be careful .  In 2008 , 400,000 student participate in athletics , but only one of every 25 of those student go on to compete professionally .  Meaning , many of the player participate in March Madness will not actually graduate .  STUDENT-ATHLETES OFTEN END UP IDENTIFYING MORE AS ATHLETESLow graduation rate arent incredibly shock when you realize that most student-athletes end up identify more a athlete than student .  An NCAA study on the experience of college athlete reveal that 60 % of student-athletes report view themselves `` more a athlete than student .  COACHES OFTEN DONT FOLLOW PRACTICE LIMITSUnfortunately , coach may be exacerbate the student athlete mistake identity a simply an athlete .  But accord to NCAA rule , no student athlete can be represent by an agent and still qualify to play at the college level .  However , parent can act a unofficial advocate , and good yet , student can advocate for themselves a well .
***** College sport have turn into a multi-billion dollar industry where everyones get rich except the student actually do the work .  The student most affect by the NCAA rule that prohibit athlete from receive any form of payment from their school , besides scholarship or outside source , be from low-income household .  Low-income student who do not have the ability to absorb extra cost may also struggle to find the time to work a part-time job to supplement their scholarship , because of their intense schedule .  Many of them dont graduate or , if they do , they don ’ t get the same education a their peer .  com/0ocUXww7Wf Chris Murphy ( @ ChrisMurphyCT ) July 25 , 2019 In recent year there have be some change to scholarship for athlete include the addition of the cost of attendance stipend , which be a $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 cash grant that student can use to cover extra expense not cover by their scholarship .
***** A few day after win the national championship game in January , Jones shock fan and football analyst by say he wasnt ready to go pro , that it be important for him to graduate from college first .  Despite the NCAAs insistence that it be concern about student athlete academic growth , it often feel a though student play second fiddle to athlete .  The University of North Carolina and Syracuse be just two of the most recent university to be under the spotlight for academic scandal involve student athlete .  UNC offer a no show class for student athlete ( where student receive grade for phantom class that they didnt attend ) , and Syracuse allow academically ineligible athlete to compete .  And what about the student athletes themselves ? .
***** The humble Cape Coral High alum graduate in June with a 4 .  Tarver say many student would be thrill to receive a P .  Antwoine Beard , Physical Education Instructor at Quality Life Center , have see his own student overlook like Tarver .  He say that emphasis on athletic ability could be base on what student athlete can do for the school .
***** The College Board Get up-to-date information on all the change for student and educator affect by coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) .  Choosing a College NCAA Course Work Requirements NCAA Eligibility Basics Finding Colleges That Fit Facilitating the Application Process Explaining Financial Aid College choice and application process for athlete For all college-bound student , the process of choose and apply to college have many step .  These student may need to .  If you be work with a student who want to get a scholarship to play a Division I sport , talk with the coach to see if the plan be realistic .  The college coach will see the athlete play and the student can check out the feel of the campus .
***** The NCAA brag about give athlete the opportunity to graduate , but it ignore the fact that many of those degree be relatively worthless .  If an athlete major in interdepartmental study or general study , either because that 's all they could handle or the coach tell them to , have the school do that student a service ? .  The NCAA and it member school will have you believe that if they help graduate an athlete they have do that athlete life 's great favor .
***** In other word , must high education adopt pay for play instead of treat athlete a student , whose most important activity on campus be obtain a college education ? .  Our team analyze datasets track over 20,000 student from high school until their early 20 and find that student-athletes finish high school at high rate , attend college at high rate , graduate college at the same or high rate , and be earn a much or more than otherwise comparable non-athletes .  Detractors of the amateur model often compare graduation rate for football player from disadvantage background to rate in the general college population , where more student be affluent .
***** During one of the most successful run of any program in volleyball history , Hunter manage to graduate in four year .  In her final season of eligibility , she be in graduate school work toward a Master of Business Administration .  The volleyball team a a whole graduate 100 percent of their player .  Even with the added responsibility of athletics , female student athlete throughout the country be have more success than male student athlete and non-student athlete when it come to graduate .  Since the 1980s , woman have graduate college at a high rate than men .  But since the NCAA start track the rate of it athlete in the mid-1990s , data show that a an overall group , Division I female athlete far exceed male athlete academically , and even exceed the female student body a a whole .  NCAA data from the most recent group study student who start in 2010 and be track over a six-year period show female student athlete have a report graduation rate of 75 percent , 14 percentage point great than the male student athlete rate .  The graduation rate of the entire female student body for that same cohort be 68 percent .  Under that measure , the gap be still wide woman in college sport graduate at a rate 11 percentage point high than men but that gap be narrow .  the Federal Graduation Rate and the NCAAs own formula call Graduation Success Rate , which be develop in what the NCAA say be an attempt to calculate a more accurate rate for it student athlete .  Overall Division I Trends When put the yearly female student athlete rate next to their counterpart , it easy to see just how far above the rest of the field they have be for the past decade and a half .  Another way that show the extent of female athlete graduate at high rate than male athlete be by compare the overall rate of individual sport .  The student athletes that enter college and leave before completion have a direct impact on the graduation rate .
***** However , they continue to make thing hard on athlete than any other segment of the student body .  No other student be prevent from take class and study for their future profession .  But student who want to become professional athlete be force into the song and dance of another major .  Like every other student , they would be require to attend class and meet condition within their major .  These course would allow the student to theoretically be good prepare for the social and career difficulty that so many young athlete struggle with out of college , like handle million of dollar in an instant or navigate the social responsibility of be out on a Saturday night .
***** “ When we start talk about these thing and when student athletes speak up about it , that ’ s how change happen , ” Prince tell “ Good Morning America ” in April .  According to a new survey by the organization College Pulse,1 college student be overwhelmingly say that enough be enough when it come to gender equity and name , image and likeness right in college sport .  Just 17 percent of college student “ strongly ” or “ somewhat ” agree that the NCAA treat men ’ s and woman ’ s sport equally .  That opinion be relatively consistent regardless of the student ’ gender , a 22 percent of male student , 15 percent of female student and 4 percent of nonbinary student believe that the NCAA ’ s treatment be equal .  2 Students disapprove of the NCAA on gender equity Share of student in a College Pulse survey by response to the statement “ The NCAA treat men ’ s and woman ’ s sport equally , ” total and by gender By Gender Total Male Female Nonbinary Strongly agree Somewhat agree Somewhat disagree Strongly disagree No answer Survey of 829 college student at 51 university conduct May 13-June 10 , 2021 , with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 .  College Pulse “ They don ’ t do enough to promote woman ’ s sport and sport event in addition to lack of coverage of woman ’ s event in general , ” a student from Colorado College write in the survey .  However , many college student likely have limit knowledge of the NCAA or college sport in general , and a viral video of an inadequate weight room may attract their attention in way that more subtle gender discrimination might not .
***** Athletes in the corporate model [ of college ] be recruit differently , be subsidize differently , and be admit to college for very different reason than for other student ( Sack and Saurowsky 5 ) .  Instead , I propose a system that will ensure that college athlete at institution want to grow a student and athlete , by implement a minor-league for those basketball and football player who would only attend college because it be their only option for develop their athletic skill .  Being able to identify with a prosperous athletic program allow a student , alumnus , or fan to feel associate with part of the school storied tradition .  Such exploitative practice be common in the late 1800s when university use collegiate sport a a bridge to link the high culture of the university with the mass culture of the broad society , which , of course , provide both their student and their resource ( Sack and Staurowsky 20 ) .  In 1906 , the position the NCAA take on amateurism be unyielding in it stipulation that the offering of inducement to player to enter college or university because of their athletic ability or support or maintain player while student on account of their athletic ability be illegal ( Sack and Staurowsky 33-34 ) .  At that time , the NCAA felt that athlete should be select from those student who be already on campus rather than recruit student by offer them financial incentive ( Sack and Staurowsky 33-34 ) .  But contrarily , the statistic show that black athlete at top-tier educational institution ( ie Duke University , Rice University , Stanford University ) graduate at low rate than their school black population ( see appendix B ) point to the conclusion that these athlete be not recruit with the same academic standard ( The Academic Performance of Black Student-athletes at Highly Ranked Universities 30 ) .  Although some research may point to African-American athlete be more academically prepared and successful than non-athletic African-American student , the statistic be mislead because financing college be not take into account .
***** R & DE have make a number of highly unpopular decision , include force almost every student currently in undergraduate housing to move to a new residence after winter break and remove oven from undergraduate apartment in order to force them onto a wildly expensive and inadequate meal plan .  Meanwhile , there be many student still stick at home , with abusive parent , lack of internet and technology access , crowd house and otherwise poor learn situation who would greatly benefit from come back to campus .  But Stanford kick out all of the “ regular ” student from Mirrielees .  sign of affluence that separate athlete into a clearly distinct and superior class , cause rift within the student community .  That ’ s a hefty expense for most student .
Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on an assault weapons ban.
***** I support them , `` and then say , `` And I would protect our Second Amendment right to bear arm .  First , letÍs look at some of the thing Romney have say about gun control .  Edward Kennedy , Romney support two gun control measure -- the Brady Bill , which require background check for gun purchase , and a ban on certain type of assault weapon .

***** Part of it be see if we can get an assault weapon ban reintroduce .  They use those weapon against their own citizen and kill Americans with them .  the Brady Law , which impose a five-day waiting period on gun sale , and a ban on certain assault weapon , say , `` I think they will help .  You sign the nation 's first ban on assault weapon in Massachusetts and steeply increased fee on gun owner by 400 % .  the so-called Brady Bill , which restrict the sale of handgun , and the assault weapon ban .
***** He may not have be think about some of the secondary issue involve in this plan , such a the fact that it would require O ’ Donnell to talk , which would involve her say awkward thing like , “ he ’ s be consistent since he change his mind .  Romney be set to sign a bill that ban assault weapon but that also have some provision gun-rights group like .  By Sarah Jones If conservative justice side with Mississippi ’ s abortion ban , many woman will not escape .
***** More state ban be on the way .
***** Media Matters for America In an October 16 column , Washington Times senior opinion editor Emily Miller praise Mitt Romney 's opposition to gun violence prevention legislation while fearmongering about President Obama ' s support for an assault weapon ban .  But Miller do not acknowledge that Mitt Romney have be a proponent of assault weapon ban -- a recently a the last time that he run for president .  During a February 18 , 2007 interview with ABC 's George Stephanopoulos , Romney be ask to reconcile his support for an assault weapon ban and the Brady background check law with his then-recent decision to join the National Rifle Association .  You sign an assault weapon ban into law , and you say in the past , I do n't line up with the NRA .

[ H ] e offer conflict statement , say that a president he would have sign a law renew the federal ban .
***** But overall , Massachusetts voter be rather predictable on gun , and in 2004 Romney sign what the AP would later call “ one of the tough assault weapon law in the country .  “ I 've be a hunter pretty much all my life , ” he say .
***** Obama “ have spend a lifetime voting against the Second Amendment — voting for gun ban [ and ] vote for ammo ban , ” say Andrew Arulanandam , the NRA ’ s director of public affair say of Obama .  “ We don ’ t know all the fact to this case , and neither do the medium , ” Arulanandam say .  “ The President ’ s record make clear that he support and respect the Second Amendment , and we ’ ll fight back against any attempt to mislead voter , ” say Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt .  Romney will attempt to make it an issue , but if he do I think it will simply reinforce what many of u think about him and that , quite frankly , be that he have no core belief and that he will say whatever he need to say to try to win vote and get elect , ” Strickland say .

***** Its true that Romney have change or modify his position on some major issue include abortion , a federal assault weapon ban and Reaganomics , a the DNC say .  The DNC say Romney flip-flopped on the Wall Street bailout when , in fact , he have consistently support it original intent but oppose Obama ’ s decision to extend TARP and use it fund for other program , include the auto bailout .  But , again , Romney support some of the program goal , but he say those kind of issue ought to be handle at the state level , not federal .  While run for president four year ago , Romney manage to be both for the federal assault weapon ban and against revive it after it expire .  ” But he be speak in opposition to use TARP money for new program , say .  Romney respond , in part , by say .  In do so , the president echo Romneys comment to King , say that TARP have serve it original purpose .  But the president go on to say that he now want to use TARP fund to invest in job creation on Main Street rather than on Wall Street .  But it can not say that Romney flip-flop on TARP , when he have not waver from his support of what Obama call the original purpose of program .  In it video , the DNC use a clip of MSNBCs Chris Matthews from May 25 say that Romney flip-flop on the auto bailout .  It be also consistent with what Romney say in the June 3 TV interview that the DNC misappropriate for it Web video .  But it also true that Romney have consistently say that he against the federal effort and that state should be free to make whatever change fit their particular circumstance .  Others have contrast Romneys 1994 letter with his statement in a 2007 presidential debate , in which he say of the dont ask , dont tell policy , I wouldnt change it at this point .  The bad we can say about the DNC video be that it use a selective clip from a 2008 presidential debate in which Romney say he doesnt favor a new law , but it edit out his statement that he would have extend the old one .  Mike Huckabee who scold him for support an extension of the old federal assault weapon ban , which Huckabee say be really a denial of the Second Amendment that Romney also claim to support .

***** Crime Guns Trafficking & Straw Purchasing BROWSE STATE LAWS SHARE Gun trafficking and straw purchasing dangerously undermine state ’ gun safety law and drive the illegal firearm market .  Due to inconsistent regulation that varies widely from state to state , gun move far too easily from state with weak gun law into state with strong gun law .  Gun traffic be the process by which gun enter the black market and end up be use in crime , while straw purchasing be a tactic where a person buy a gun on behalf of someone else , who be usually ineligible to purchase it .  There be currently no federal anti-trafficking law , allow criminal to exploit weakness in the system and flood community with illegal gun .

***** Psychology can make important contribution to policy that prevent gun violence .  Toward this end , in February 2013 the American Psychological Association commission this report by a panel of expert to convey research-based conclusion and recommendation ( and to identify gap in such knowledge ) on how to reduce the incidence of gun violence — whether by homicide , suicide , or mass shoot — nationwide .  Developmental Issues A complex and variable constellation of risk and protective factor make person more or less likely to use a firearm against themselves or others .  For this reason , there be no single profile that can reliably predict who will use a gun in a violent act .  Instead , gun violence be associate with a confluence of individual , family , school , peer , community , and sociocultural risk factor that interact over time during childhood and adolescence .  Although many youth desist in aggressive and antisocial behavior during late adolescence , others be disproportionately at risk for become involve in or otherwise affect by gun violence .  Reducing incident of gun violence arise from criminal misconduct or suicide be an important goal of broad primary and secondary prevention and intervention strategy .  Such strategy must also attend to redirect developmental antecedent and large sociocultural process that contribute to gun violence and gun-related death .  Gender and Culture Any account of gun violence in the United States must be able to explain both why male be perpetrator of the vast majority of gun violence and why the vast majority of male never perpetrate gun violence .  Such intervention need to be far test for their potential to reduce gun violence .  The skill and knowledge of psychologist be need to develop and evaluate program and setting in school , workplace , prison , neighborhood , clinic , and other relevant context that aim to change gendered expectation for male that emphasize self-sufficiency , toughness , and violence , include gun violence .  Risk for gun violence involve similar risk process , although the complexity and variability of individual mean there be no meaningful profile that allow reliable prediction of who will eventually engage in gun violence .

Fearing that the federal government would use it stand army to force it will on the state , the author of the Second Amendment intend to protect the state militia ’ right to bear arm .  According to some gun control supporter , in modern time , the amendment should protect only the state ’ right to arm their own military force , include their National Guard unit .

***** State gun law restrict who have access to gun significantly reduce rate of firearm-related homicide August 6 , 2019 28 Jessica Colarossi Kat J .  , and Dayton , Ohio—Boston University School of Public Health researcher Michael Siegel say that mirror analysis of Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and Centers for Disease Control & Prevention ( CDC ) homicide data serve to double down on evidence that control who have access to gun have much more impact on reduce gun-related homicide than control what gun people have .  Despite the fact that opponent of gun regulation be say , We dont know whats go on , it mental health issue , it these crazy people , which doesnt lend itself to a solution—the truth be that we have a pretty good grasp at whats go on .  People who shouldnt have access to gun be get access .

Laws prohibit the possession of firearm by people who have be convict of a violent crime be associate with an 18 percent reduction in homicide rate .  None of the state gun law study be find to be relate to overall suicide rate .  Universal background check , which have long be a top priority for gun control advocate and policymakers in the United States , appear to have the big impact .  Though there have be a push for federal gun regulation in recent year , the power to legislate gun sale and gun ownership be largely beholden to the state .  The average firearm homicide rate in state without background check be 58 percent high than the average in state with background-check law in place .  Its often a topic of debate if people be the problem or gun themselves but this study meet at the intersection of these stance to say it the law that allow for certain people to acquire gun that be the problem .

( FBI , [ 6 ] NSSF [ 7 ] ) AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifle be not the fully-automatic , military-grade firearm they be often claim to be by gun control supporter and the medium .  The terrorist attack in France and Belgium show that gun bans—including those on semi-automatic firearm and standard-capacity magazines—don ’ t prevent crime .  Gun control supporter be wrong to claim that “ assault weapon ” be use in most mass shooting .  Firearms that gun control supporter call “ assault weapon ” and ammunition magazine that they call “ large ” be among the arm protect by the Second Amendment .
***** With the renew push by the federal government for an assault weapon ban , we couldn ’ t help but wonder , just how often be assault rifle really to blame for crime ? .  More specifically , how often be they use a murder weapon when compare to all of the other type of weapon available ? .  Using FBI homicide statistic from the 2019 Crime in the United States report , the insight team at the Joslyn Law Firm chart out how often different type of weapon be use in homicide in the U .  Non-firearm weapon be use for one-quarter of all homicide in the United States .  With rifle be a relatively uncommon type of weapon use in homicide in the United States , an assault rifle ban may not make much difference when it come to the number of murder that occur .  Homicides be overwhelmingly commit use handgun ; they be find to be the most common murder weapon for nearly half of all homicide in the United States in 2019 .  Even hand , fist , and foot be use to commit homicide almost twice as often a a rifle be .

It find that gun ownership by household have decline steadily from about half , in the late 1970s and early 1980s , down to 32 % in 2015 .  1994 when household gun ownership exceed 50 % , accord to Gallup poll .  In 2016 , household firearm ownership still exceed 35 % , and there be a long-term trend of decline support for strict gun control law .
***** The city of Chicago file a lawsuit Monday against a northern Indiana gun store it claim be one of the main source of illicit firearm for the city 's criminal market .  The suit , file with the litigation arm of Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund and the law firm Mayer Brown LLP , seek `` long overdue accountability `` in the form of unspecified damage and an order require the store to cease practice contribute to gun trafficking .  `` Time and time again , however , it have become even more clear that hold accountable all those who contribute to gun violence here , regardless of where they be locate , be key to our ability to create a safe Chicago .  city , Chicago consistently report a low gun homicide rate , per caput , than other city like Detroit , New Orleans and St .

***** Biden-Harris Administration Announces Comprehensive Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gun Crime and Ensure Public Safety June 23 , 2021 Statements and Releases President Biden believe that the surge in gun violence that have affect community across the country over the last year and a half be unacceptable , and his Administration be move decisively to act with a whole-of-government approach a we enter the summer month when city typically experience a spike in violence .

***** The way to reduce gun violence be by convince ordinary , “ responsible ” handgun owner that their weapon make them , their family , and those around them less safe .  Americans also stock up on gun .  They buy more than 23 million firearm in 2020 , up 65 percent from 2019 .  First-time gun purchase be notably high .  3 million gun , a monthly record .  Last year be also a high-water mark for gun violence—more people be shoot dead than at any time since the 1990s—though 2021 be shape up to be even bad .  Americans use their gun to open fire on one another at backyard barbecue , to stalk and intimidate ex-spouse and lover , to rob and assault , and to kill themselves .  Half of the almost 48,000 suicide commit in 2019 be carry out by gun .  All of this slaughter be enable by the most permissive gun law in the developed world .
***** At the same time , President Joe Biden and other policymakers earlier this year propose new restriction on firearm access in an effort to address gun violence range from rise murder rate in some major city to mass shooting .  Here be some key find about Americans ’ attitude about gun violence , gun policy and other subject , drawn from recent survey by Pew Research Center and Gallup .  In the aftermath of several recent mass shooting in the United States , Pew Research Center conduct this analysis to share key fact about Americans and gun .  We use data from our own polling and from Gallup survey to provide insight into Americans ’ view on gun policy and how those view have change over time , as well a to examine the proportion of adult who own gun themselves and their reason for do so .  Data about the number of monthly gun background check come from the FBI ’ s National Instant Criminal Background Check System .  adult say they live in a household with a gun , include 30 % who say they personally own one , accord to a Pew Research Center survey conduct in June 2021 .  There be difference in gun ownership rate by political party affiliation , gender , geography and other factor .  For instance , 44 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independent say they personally own a gun , compare with 20 % of Democrats and Democratic leaner .
***** Protecting our community from violent crime be a top priority for the Department of Justice and one of our most important responsibility .  As our participant in today roundtable have note , the increase in violent crime in 2020 and early 2021 be deeply trouble .  That be why , last month , the Justice Department launch a comprehensive violent crime reduction strategy .  set strategic enforcement priority ; foster trust with and earn legitimacy in our community ; invest in community-based prevention and intervention program ; and measure the result of these effort through a decrease in violent crime , not merely by arrest and conviction , a if they be end in themselves .  Now , we know that the lion share of violent crime reduction work be shoulder by our state , local , Tribal , and territorial law enforcement partner .  attorney office be work with it local partner to establish an immediate plan to address the spike in violent crime that typically occur during the summer .  And the law enforcement component of the Department be make enhanced resource available to help prevent and disrupt violent crime , and to focus on the most dangerous , most violent offender .  The Department be also strengthen our Project Safe Neighborhoods our cornerstone initiative that bring together law enforcement and community stakeholder to develop solution to press violent crime problem .  The Justice Department have available over $ 1 billion in funding through over a dozen grant program that can be use to support evidence-based , community violence intervention strategy .  We know that an effective violent crime reduction strategy must also address the illegal trafficking of firearm and focus on keep gun out of the wrong hand .  And if they do , then local and federal law enforcement can better coordinate to trace illegal gun sale back to the shady gun dealer and hold them accountable .
***** To some observer this suggest that one method for reduce the burden of firearm injury be to intervene in these market so a to make it more expensive , inconvenient , or legally risky to obtain firearm for criminal use .  As gun become more expensive to acquire or hold , it be hypothesize that criminal will reduce the percentage of their criminal career in which they be in possession of a gun .  However , the pervasiveness of gun and the variety of legal and illegal mean of acquire them suggest the difficulty of keep firearm from people bar by law from possess them .  Market-based intervention intend to reduce criminal access to gun include tax on weapon and ammunition , tough regulation of federal firearm licensee , limit on the number of firearm that can be purchase in a give time period , gun ban , gun buy-backs , and enforcement of law against illegal gun buyer or seller .  Other intervention that may have market effectsfor example , storage requirement ( such a trigger lock or the placement of firearm in secure container ) and mandate new technology that personalize gun so only lawful owner can fire themare dealt with in detail elsewhere in the report .  While these new technology may make new gun less attractive relative to old secondhand gun and thus reduce the attractiveness of gun in aggregate to offender , the potential market effect be probably secondary to other mechanism by which Suggested Citation .  , gun ownership pattern , type of gun use in crime ) , there be only a few study , often not well connect , that have be adequately summarize in exist paper ( e .  We begin with a brief discussion of legal and illegal firearm commerce , follow by a summary of what be know about the method by which offender acquire gun .  We then present an analytic framework to understand the effect of specific intervention on gun market .  A wait period law inconvenience hunter and others who use firearm in legitimate fashion .  involve and may disguise the illegal transaction by falsify the paper record of sale or report the gun a steal .  We do not know whether this be drive by difference in the quality of the gun purchase or in the cost of distribution in the two sector .  Trace data , reflect firearm recover by police and other law enforcement agency , have reveal that a noteworthy proportion of gun have a time to crime ( the length of time from the first retail sale to recovery by the police ) of a few month or a few year .
***** Crime Guns Bulk Gun Purchases BROWSE STATE LAWS SHARE Regulating bulk firearm purchase be a straightforward , effective way to reduce gun trafficking and save life .  Laws limit the number of firearm a person can purchase within a certain timeframe help reduce the number of gun that enter the secondary market—weapons that be more likely to wind up at the scene of a crime .  Only a handful of state limit bulk gun purchase , a policy that have be prove to reduce gun trafficking and consequently gun violence .  Background Laws limit the number of gun someone can buy within a certain span of time help reduce gun trafficking .  Interstate trafficking of firearm flourish , in part , because state regulate sale differently , and there be no federal limit on the number of gun an individual may purchase at any one time .  States with weak gun law attract trafficker who make multiple purchase and then resell those firearm in state with strong gun law .  Federal law define a “ multiple sale ” a the sale of two or more gun to the same purchaser within five business day .  A study of crime gun recovery in Baltimore find that gun purchase in multiple sale be significantly more likely than gun purchase in single sale to be recover from a possessor who be not the original buyer .
***** I look for a state that ’ s take gun violence seriously .  Massachusetts offer a model for deal with gun violence that the rest of the country could follow .  I look for a state that ’ s take gun violence seriously .  In New Hampshire , the process for buy a gun be easy — easy than get a driver ’ s license .  You go to a gun store , you show your ID , and if you pass a background check that look at your criminal record and some of your mental health history , you can walk out with a firearm .  No registration of the gun .  Private seller — say , a family member or someone online — can sell you a gun without any background check at all .  First off , it doesn ’ t begin at a gun shop ; it begin by obtain a permit to purchase a gun from your local police department — basically , a gun license .  Only once you clear that entire process can you go to a gun store .  If you do that , you can get your gun , which will have to be register in a database of all the state ’ s firearm , the Massachusetts Gun Transactions Portal .  Even if your dad give you a gun , he have to make sure you have a firearm license and that the transfer of the gun be record in the state database — or seriously risk legal trouble of his own , since police may notice he ’ s not in possession of a firearm the database indicate he own .  “ It ’ s another opportunity for law enforcement to identify individual who might be too risky to have gun , ” he say .
***** Has A Lot Of Guns Involved In Crimes But Very Little Data On Where They Came From In August , police in Pennsylvania and New Jersey arrest three men they say be smuggle untraceable gun across state line .  Prosecutors have charge the men with several crime relate to a scheme in which they allegedly buy unfinished gun part in Pennsylvania , assemble them into untraceable firearm with no serial number and sell them in New Jersey .  Police use a confidential informant to buy nine handgun , six semi-automatic rifle , nine large-capacity magazine and a silencer , accord to one of the men ’ s arrest affidavit .  Unfinished gun part that don ’ t meet the legal definition of a firearm aren ’ t regulate under federal law , which allow people who can legally own gun to build these kind of untraceable firearm for personal use .  The case highlight the problem of so-called “ ghost gun , ” untraceable homemade weapon that can be assemble from kit buy online , in store or at gun show — or even 3D print use plan available online .  In 2019 , police in Philadelphia recover 95 ghost gun , accord to data the department share with FiveThirtyEight .  But it ’ s still just roughly 9 percent of the 4,190 gun that Philadelphia police recover during the same time period this year .  Most gun involve in crime take more well-worn route , like straw purchasing or theft , Vanore say .  Often , he say , police find traffic gun only after they be use in a crime .  ” Any gun can become a crime gun — it just have to be use in a crime .  Since ATF trace only to the first retail sale , it can ’ t see if someone buy a preowned gun at a pawnshop and then use it in a crime the next day , for example .  ” The same be true of the handful of local , state and federal prison survey that ask people convict of crime involve gun where they get their weapon .  “ And it doesn ’ t tell you the path which that gun take to get to that individual .  Other expert say it ’ s not uncommon for criminal to break into car outside event that ban weapon — at a stadium , for example — or to target vehicle where there ’ s some visible indication that the owner might be a gun enthusiast .  Some crime gun also come from the secondary market — gun show , online classify site that specialize in firearm as well a other private sale that don ’ t require a background check under federal law .  Finally , problem with the gun background check system sometimes let people who can ’ t legally own a gun buy one from a licensed dealer .
***** These figure be calculate from a total of 125 report case over this period , mean handgun be involve in about 78 percent of mass shooting .  The involvement of semi-automatic rifle in mass shoot Owing to their use in several high-profile mass shooting , there have be much public discussion over suitability or necessity of assault weapon for the purpose of self-defense .  This figure be underreported though , a it exclude the multiple semi-automatic ( and fully automatic ) rifle use in the 2017 Las Vegas Strip massacre .  In fact , semi-automatic rifle be feature in four of the five deadly mass shooting , be use in the Orlando nightclub massacre , Sandy Hook Elementary massacre and Texas First Baptist Church massacre .

The good news be that with a rise enrollment across the Lone Star State , school district be stay competitive with their salary , so there be a way for teacher to have both a rewarding career and a paycheck that bring a smile .  Factors That Influence Salaries Your teach salary be a combination of several factor with the Texas Education Agency ( TEA ) set a minimum of $ 33,660 for teacher with no experience .

***** But within half an hour , a rescuer work within the school , a man drove to the scene in a truck load with dynamite and detonate it , kill himself and four bystander .  Even in an age like ours , well acquaint with school violence , the Bath School massacre can be shock to learn about .  Afterward , the local sheriff heard Kehoe mutter , “ If it hadn ’ t be for that $ 300 school tax , I might have pay off this mortgage .  ” Kehoe have clearly go mad , but the focus of his rage , against the world and the school , be center on high property tax .  The levy be the foundation of local government , account for nearly three-quarters of their tax and underpin their school system .  state and local law have attenuate the tax ’ s connection to local benefit , make it a tool of redistribution , degrade the transparency of it administration , and expand the shadowy district that receive it revenue .  The tax can also be tie to explicitly local benefit , such a school , park , and police and fire protection .  When government offer good service at low cost , the add value get “ capitalize ” in the value of land and home .  Ironically , this lead to school district in city with many impoverished student , such a San Francisco and Austin , Texas , send money to middle-class suburb with lot of homeowner but few commercial property .  Though some rail at the inequity of these exception , city understand that farmer and the elderly use less of the social service , especially school , that represent the main benefit of local government .

In this analysis , we use claim data from large employer plan to estimate the incidence of out-of-network charge associate with hospital stay and emergency visit that could result in a surprise bill .  We find that million of emergency visit and hospital stay put people with large employer coverage at risk of receive a surprise bill .  For people in large employer plan , 18 % of all emergency visit and 16 % of in-network hospital stay have at least one out-of-network charge associate with the care in 2017 .  For people with large employer coverage , emergency visit and in-network inpatient stay be both more likely to result in at least one out-of-network charge in Texas , New York , Florida , New Jersey , and Kansas , and less likely in Minnesota , South Dakota , Nebraska , Maine , and Mississippi .  For example , a preferred provider health plan ( PPO ) might require a patient to pay 20 % of allow charge for in-network service and 40 % of allow charge for out-of-network service .  In an HMO or other closed-network plan , the out-of-network service might not be cover at all .  As a result , patient can be liable for the balance bill in addition to any applicable out-of-network cost sharing .

***** Expelled uninsured patient in a less-competitive hospital market in Florida , USA .  Full Text Expelled uninsured patient in a less-competitive hospital market in Florida , USA Keon-Hyung Lee1 , Seunghoo Lim2 & Jungwon Park3 International Journal for Equity in Health volume 15 , Article number .  85 ( 2016 ) Cite this article AbstractBackgroundThis research evaluate the effect of hospital competition on inward and outward patient transfer for different type of payer include the uninsured .  Although it be a less spotlighted issue , an equally important topic be the likelihood of inter-hospital patient transfer of the insured and the uninsured .  This study attempt to fill a gap in the research about the relationship between hospital competition and patient transfer .  MethodsBy develop the payer-specific level of hospital competition , this research evaluate the effect of hospital competition on inward and outward patient sharing ( or patient transfer ) for different type of payer include the uninsured .  For patient transfer , instead of focus on whether a patient be transfer from one hospital to another hospital at the patient level , we measure the number of patient transfer between hospital ( both inward and outward ) at the hospital level .  ResultsControlling for hospital characteristic , when the uninsured Hirschman-Herfindahl Index ( HHI ) increase by 0 .  01 , the uninsured be 593 % more likely to be transfer to another hospital .  When a hospital dominate it market , it tend to expel uninsured patient to other hospital .  Since the uninsured who be admit to a hospital that dominate it hospital market be likely to be much more vulnerable in their access to health care service , the state government of Florida need to move toward increased health insurance coverage for eligible Floridians .  Although the coverage for non-elderly Americans increase between 2011 and 2012 [ 2 ] , the number of the uninsured be still over 47 million in the U .  As our find indicate , the uninsured who be admit to a hospital that dominate it hospital market be likely to be much more vulnerable in their access to health care service , require the state government of Florida to move toward increased health insurance coverage for eligible Floridians .  Even though Florida ’ s Low Income Pool ( LIP ) health-funding program have be recently extend for two additional year [ 25 ] , the fund help hospital cover the cost of treat uninsured and underinsured patient after the fact , rather than increase eligible Floridians ’ health insurance coverage a the Medicaid expansion program would have do .

The Florida Health Security Plan , which Governor Chiles propose in 1992 and which be ultimately reject by the state legislature , represent an expansion of insurance coverage together with a manage competition approach to control health cost .  It have one of the high uninsured rate in the country , 19 .  The cost to the state ( or to local area ) be estimate at $ 222 million .  While the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ensures that most of these individual will retain their benefit , future immigrant will not be cover .  To reduce the number of uninsured child , the governor have propose expand Medicaid to cover child age 0 to 3 old year in household with income up to 185 percent of the FPL .  The legislature recently grant the Agency for Health Care Administration the authority to seek a Section 1115 waiver to cover child in household with income up to 185 percent of the FPL through the Healthy Kids Program .  The cost of the program average about $ 600 per child .  The program be able to keep the cost below Medicaid because of limit on the number of plan , because of some restriction on benefit , and because the population serve be relatively healthy .  Florida also create 11 regional Community Health Purchasing Alliances ( CHPAs ) in an attempt to reduce the cost of health insurance in the small-group market .  The hospital market have a considerable amount of excess capacity .

The government want to remove some of the sticker shock , so it pass a bill call the “ No Surprises Act ” at the end of 2020 to stop some of the cost gouging .  The No Surprises Act make it illegal for hospital to charge more than the in-network cost for medical service .  That be crucial when you arrive at a hospital in an emergency situation and the hospital or the doctor treat you or other assist aren ’ t part of your in-network coverage .  When that happen , you get charge the exorbitant out-of-network cost .  This typically happen in emergency case , but also happen in non-emergencies when patient receive hospital care from out-of-network provider .  It ’ s always a good idea to examine all self-pay option because it ’ s likely that insurance will pay only a portion of the bill .

***** To assess the prevalence of abortion among population group and change in rate between 2008 and 2014 .  We use secondary data from the Abortion Patient Survey , the American Community Survey , and the National Survey of Family Growth to estimate abortion rate .  We use information from the Abortion Patient Survey to estimate the lifetime incidence of abortion .  Between 2008 and 2014 , the abortion rate decline 25 % , from 19 .  6 per 1000 woman age 15 to 44 year .  The abortion rate for adolescent age 15 to 19 year decline 46 % , the large of any group .  Abortion rate decline for all racial and ethnic group but be large for non-White woman than for non-Hispanic White woman .  Although the abortion rate decrease 26 % for woman with income less than 100 % of the federal poverty level , this population have the high abortion rate of all the group examine .  If the 2014 age-specific abortion rate prevail , 24 % of woman age 15 to 44 year in that year will have an abortion by age 45 year .  The decline in abortion be not uniform across all population group .  1,2 In 2014 , 926 190 abortion be perform in the United States ; the abortion rate be 14 .  6 abortion per 1000 woman age 15 to 44 year , mean that in that year 1 .  5 % of woman of reproductive age have an abortion .  2,5 However , the abortion rate have decline substantially since that time—14 % between 2011 and 2014 alone3—and it be likely that the estimate of the lifetime incidence of abortion have also decline .  In addition to few woman have abortion , the characteristic of the woman who obtain them have change .  We combine information on abortion rate and the characteristic of woman who have abortion to determine if decline in abortion be experience by all population of woman .  Specifically , we estimate abortion rate in 2014 accord to age , income , race and ethnicity , and other characteristic , and we also examine change in population rate since 2008 , the last year these measure be generate .  As in past survey , patient at facility that report few than 30 abortion in 2011 be exclude because of the high likelihood that these facility would perform few or no abortion during the survey period .  Our analysis focus on change in abortion rate by demographic characteristic for the period between 2008 and 2014 , because 2008 be the next most recent APS .  However , the ACS be now consider more accurate than the Current Population Survey , so we reestimated population characteristic use to construct the 2008 abortion rate use the 2008 ACS .  Additionally , on the basis of the 2010 Census , the Census Bureau retrospectively adjust population total for the year 2006 through 2010 ; thus , we rely on the updated 2008 count of woman age 15 to 44 year .  To estimate the lifetime incidence of abortion , or the proportion of woman of reproductive age who will have an abortion by age 45 year , we adopt the methodology develop by Forrest .  Because first abortion rate for the young abortion patient be traditionally low than be those for old adolescent , we estimate age-specific abortion rate separately for adolescent young than 15 year .  We obtain the cumulative first abortion rate , or proportion of woman estimate to have have an abortion by the time they reach the end of a specify age range , by multiply each age-specific first abortion rate by the number of year in that age group ( e .  aOn the basis of previously publish abortion rate ( Jones and Kavanaugh4 ) and adjust to account for updated population figure and to exclude nonhospital abortion .  Between 2008 and 2014 , decline in abortion be most pronounced for cohabitating woman ( 39 % ) and low for married woman ( 21 % ) , although the latter group have a low abortion rate in both period .  The decline in the abortion rate among non-Hispanic Black woman ( 32 % ) be great than that for that non-Hispanic White woman ( 14 % ) ; decline be also substantial for Hispanic woman ( 36 % ) and non-Hispanic woman who identify with a race other than Black or White ( 39 % ) .  As income level increase , the abortion rate decrease ; woman in the high income group have an abortion rate less than half the national rate .  We use age-specific first abortion rate to estimate the lifetime incidence of abortion ( Table 2 ) .  Between 2008 and 2014 , the number of state abortion restriction increased,21 and research suggest that some of these restriction make abortion more difficult for woman to access in at least some state .  If this be the case , the large decline in abortion would actually be an indicator of racial and ethnic disparity .  This pattern parallel , but be less pronounced than , the decline in the abortion rate during that same period .

***** Secondly , next to Russia and the United States , Ukraine be the nation that have the great number of strategic and tactical nuclear weapon on the face of this Earth , and they now have zero .  And lastly , you all probably know , this morning Secretary of State Christopher at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council Foreign Ministers in Berlin have set forward procedure by which Europe can take great responsibility for it own security and defense , establish a European security and defense identity within NATO , separable but not separate , a we like to say .  We 'll start with Bob .  In a write statement release on Saturday , the President welcome the agreement that be reach in Vienna that morning which resolve the CFE flank problem and thereby preserve the CFE Treaty a a key element of a new , more stable Europe .  The President note that CFE have result in the elimination of over 50,000 piece of military equipment , include tank , artillery piece , armor combat vehicle , fighter aircraft , and attack helicopter , and have put in place a system of great transparency and inspection and confidence-building among these state .  We agree with the statement that be release in Ankara by the Turkish foreign ministry over the weekend that say -- and I 'm quote that statement -- `` This understanding prove that issue concern European security can be resolve by mean of joint decision to be reach by all the relevant country rather than through unilateral move .  first , a map realignment which reduce the area of the original CFE flank zone ; second , new constraint that will limit the amount of equipment Russia and Ukraine can deploy in the area of both country be remove from the original flank zone ; and third , increased inspection requirement in these area ; and last , increase notification concern the equipment in these area .  The agreement do not change the treaty per se -- it 's not an amendment to the treaty -- nor do it change the ceiling that be establish for the flank in the original treaty a they will now apply to this new , somewhat small flank area .  There be nothing in this agreement that require that any state transfer such increased flexibility to Russia .  If Russia , in the end , should not gain increased flexibility through decision of these other state , it will have to reduce it equipment hold in the new flank area by 215 tank , 2,000 armor combat vehicle , and 255 artillery piece .  And then in December the state will confirm that that step have be take , and the treaty then go forward on a permanent fashion .  And we 've see the treaty have be effectively hold in place through lot of change , include in the case of the START treaty and the CFE Treaty itself and the INF Treaty , these phenomenal change in the Soviet Union and Russia .  It look like they 're go to have a good six or eight month to reconsider whether they want to sign the treaty , so it 's a little bit premature to say they 'll hold to the term of it .

***** [ My health plan ] would give small business and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market .  The Obama-Reid-Pelosi plan would actually increase health premium cost for the uninsured .  The average individual health insurance premium today be $ 2985 for single and $ 6328 for family .  This be 10 to 13 percent high than they would be under current law .  Only those individual earn less than about $ 40,000 and family earn less than about $ 85,000 would receive any tax or spending benefit to even partially-offset this increase cost .  Only about 12 percent of people receive coverage from their small business employer would benefit from the small business health tax credit .  [ My plan ] would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care .  Under current law , someone cant wait until they be sick and then sign up for health insurance .  Put simply , guarantee issue would be the death of insurance .

***** I think we all know that we have inherit unprecedented budget deficit .  We will not lose sight of the need to tackle unmet need for health care reform , to deal with the energy policy that we need , and so many other challenge that be go to determine what the 21st century look like .  3 trillion deficit -- the large in our nation 's history -- and our investment to rescue our economy will add to that deficit in the short term .  We also have long-term challenge -- health care , energy , education and others -- that we can no longer afford to ignore .  We can not , and will not , sustain deficit like these without end .  Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past few year , we can not simply spend a we please and defer the consequence to the next budget , the next administration , or the next generation .  We be pay the price for these deficit right now .  That be more than three time what we spend on education that year ; more than seven time what we spend on VA health care .  So if we confront this crisis without also confront the deficit that help cause it , we risk sink into another crisis down the road a our interest payment rise , our obligation come due , confidence in our economy erode , and our child and our grandchild be unable to pursue their dream because they 're saddle with our debt .  And that 's why today I 'm pledge to cut the deficit we inherit in half by the end of my first term in office .  The time be now to put those good idea down on a piece of legislation and move forward so we have something that deliver quality health care to everybody in this country in a way that everybody can afford .

This mean far reduce health care cost , include program like Medicare and Medicaid , which be the single big contributor to our long-term deficit .  The health insurance law we pass last year will slow these rise cost , which be part of the reason that nonpartisan economist have say that repeal the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollar to our deficit .

The “ Achilles ’ heel ” of the claim that AIG shareholder be owe damage a a result of the bailout be the fact that if the government do not step in , AIG would have go bankrupt .  Therefore , even if the government impose overly strict and punitive term on it financial rescue , and even if that bailout come with no legal underpinning , it do not change the fact that AIG would have cease to exist without that lifeline , Wheeler say .

***** The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which be introduce on November 2 in the House of Representatives , would raise tax on some Americans and cut tax on others while also provide significant save to foreign investor .  Of those tax cut that would benefit Americans , nearly a third would go to the rich one percent in 2018 , and by 2027 that fraction would rise to nearly half .  Because the legislation , which will be simply call the House bill in this report , include provision that raise tax and provision that cut tax , the net effect for any particular family depend on their situation .  This report include estimate of the House bill ’ s average impact on each income group and estimate of the fraction of each income group face a tax cut or a tax hike .  The estimate incorporate all the significant change that the bill would make to the federal personal income tax , corporate income tax and estate tax , a explain in more detail in the methodology section .  Some of the provision in the House bill that benefit the middle-class — like low tax rate and few bracket , an increased standard deduction , and a $ 300 tax credit for each adult in a household — be design to expire or become less generous over time .  Some of the provision that benefit the wealthy , such a the reduction and eventual repeal of the estate tax , become more generous over time .

The effect of this tax bill on household vary a great deal , even for household in the same income group , depend on the type of income and type of expense that different family have .

For example , recent trend show high proportion of never-married woman in the population ( Tamborini 2007 ) , which would reduce the share of woman potentially eligible for spouse or widow benefit by the time they reach retirement age .  Since marital history help establish whether spouse or widow benefit will be a retirement income option for woman in old age , it be important to track marital trend , particularly a the lead edge of the baby-boom generation begin retire .  Census Bureau , the Social Security Administration have access to a Restricted-Use File of the Marital History Module , which contain the year and month of marital transition event ( marriage , divorce , widow ) .  3 To explore how marital pattern have change over the past 15 year , the article also draw on data report in Iams and Ycas ( 1988 ) , which be base on the U .

***** Animal identification ( ID ) refers to keep record on individual farm animal or group of farm animal so that they can be easily track from their birth through the marketing chain .  Historically , animal ID be use to indicate ownership and prevent theft , but the reason for identify and track animal have evolve to include rapid response to animal health and/or food safety concern .  As such , traceability be limit specifically to movement from the animal ’ s point of birth to it slaughter and process location .  On February 5 , 2010 , Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announce that USDA be revise it approach to achieve a national capability for animal disease traceability .  In it place USDA propose a new approach—Animal Disease Traceability—that will allow individual state and tribal nation to choose their own degree of within-state animal identification and traceability for livestock population .  However , under the propose revision USDA will require that all animal move in interstate commerce have a form of ID that allow traceability back to their originate state or tribal nation .  The large program govern traceability of interstate animal movement and coordination between different state and tribal nation will be implement in federal regulation through the federal rulemaking process .  Since the February announcement , USDA have hold a series of public meeting for animal health official and producer to provide opportunity for discussion and feedback .  While the poultry and pork industry have endorse a mandatory national animal ID program in general , certain portion of the U .  Participation in the initial phase of NAIS , premise registration , reflect this same degree of interest , a very high percentage of eligible premise be register for most major animal species—poultry ( 95 % ) , sheep ( 95 % ) , swine ( 80 % ) , goat ( 60 % ) , and horse ( 50 % ) —with the exception of cattle ( 18 % ) .  The Traceability Regulation Working Group , in conjunction with state and tribal animal health official , will define performance standard that will describe a desired outcome but not the method for achieve the outcome .

***** The Animal Health Protection Act ( AHPA ) enact with the 2002 Farm Bill set the legal stage for the federal government to be involve in the national animal identification effort .  Premises registration , animal identification , and animal tracking .  Premises registration be the assignation of a unique premise number to all facility where animal be manage or hold .  Animal identification assign a unique number to individual animal or lot in the case of animal that stay with the same group their entire life .  Animal track involve the collection of data for animal movement and the recording of those data in a central recordkeeping system which could be quickly and comprehensively access in the event of an animal health emergency .  The USDA state in a 2006 document that while the agency have the authority to make the system mandatory , it have choose to make every component of NAIS voluntary at the federal level ( USDA-APHIS , 2006a ) .  This guide attempt to alleviate small-scale livestock producer ’ concern about the system , state that NAIS participation be voluntary and that the NAIS would “ largely focus on commercial operation and animal ” ( USDA-APHIS , 2006b ) .  They do not believe USDA ’ s assurance that NAIS information would not be subject to Freedom of Information Act request or that use of the information would be restrict to animal health emergency .  ” For almost a decade , proponent maintain that NAIS would protect producer ’ animal , investment and neighbor , and that “ a producer become increasingly aware of the benefit of the NAIS and the level of voluntary participation grows , there will only be less need to make the program mandatory ” ( USDA-APHIS , 2006a ) .  This will require that animal health official credibly demonstrate their independence from large-scale agribusiness and from identification technology vendor .

The federal income tax credit of up to $ 7,500 for EV buyer contribute to about 40 % of EV sale during 2011 .  The electrification of the transportation sector through the diffusion of plug-in electric vehicle ( EVs ) , couple with clean electricity generation , be consider a promising pathway to reduce air pollution from on-road vehicle and to strengthen energy security .  Different from conventional gasoline vehicle with internal combustion engine , plug-in electric vehicle ( EVs ) use electricity store in rechargeable battery to power the motor , and the electricity come from external power source .  But emission shift from on-road vehicle to electricity generation , which use a domestic fuel source .  When promote consumer adoption of this technology , they can subsidize EV buyer or charge station investor or a combination of the two .  Taking advantage of a rich data set of quarterly new EV sale by model and detailed information on public charge station in 353 Metropolitan Statistical Areas ( MSAs ) from 2011 to 2013 , we quantify indirect network effect on both side of the market by estimate two equation .  To estimate the network effect of charge station on EV adoption , we use a Bartik ( 1991 ) .  style instrument for the endogenous number of electric charge station , which interact national charge station deployment shock with local market condition .  To estimate the network effect of EV stock on charge station deployment , we use current and historic gasoline price to instrument for the endogenous cumulative EV sale .

These agency face many billion of dollar in deferred maintenance of road , trail , dam , and building , much of which be in very great need of repair at this time .  I 'd also like to note that , in addition to the stimulus package , I do believe -- and I 've say this publicly several time -- that we have a real opportunity in the new Congress to make progress on comprehensive and forward-looking energy policy .  In the Denver metro region alone , the number of renewable-energy sector job triple between 2004 and 2007 .  Back then the notion that a significant multi-billion dollar investment in clean energy could be an engine of economic growth and competitiveness , and create million of high-wage manufacturing job that could not be outsource , be not well appreciate .  Given last week 's job report where we lose an unexpectedly large number of job in November -- 533,000 of them -- bring the total to 1 .  9 million job so far this year -- we need to do more than our action during the first lame duck session last month of extend unemployment insurance compensation for an additional 13 to 26 week .  8 billion a day , and give that we could face a trillion dollar budget deficit for FY ` 09 even if we do n't pass a second stimulus bill ; I will want to be very certain that a new stimulus bill be not just a glorified supplemental appropriation bill .  When every dollar we be spend be go to have to be borrow , admittedly at this moment at low interest rate , this bill be go to have to make America 's economy more productive in order for u to afford to pay this money back in the future without diminish our standard of living and harm our way of life .

***** The propose legislation , if enact in a form similar to one of it most recent version , would cover a majority of people who now lack health insurance , and it would raise revenue and increase spending without increase the deficit over the next 10 year ( Congressional Budget Office , 2009f ) .  Although the propose legislation include provision that have the potential to reduce the long-term growth of both federal and private-sector health spending , most of the provision be to be implement a demonstration or experiment rather than systemwide .  The growth rate of federal health spending have be high than the growth rate of the economy for more than three decade .  That increase would be offset by increase in federal revenue of $ 264- $ 574 billion and a combination of spending change that would save $ 427- $ 483 billion .  the result would be a net reduction in federal deficit of $ 109- $ 132 billion .  In the second decade , the Congressional Budget Office ( 2009f , 2009i ) expect the spending and revenue provision of the House and Senate bill to slightly reduce federal budget deficit ( relative to those project under current law ) , by between zero and 0 .  The effect of the spending provision alone would be even more modest .  lic program ( and tax expenditure ) that have direct effect on the federal budget .  The service pay for by Medicare and Medicaid ( and other federal health program ) be similar to those deliver in the private health care system by the same provider ( doctor , hospital , image facility , nurse home , etc .  Indeed , some idea for cost saving may even require some up-front increase in spending .  According to the same analysis , nominal spending for Medicare and Medicaid will grow at an average rate of around 6 percent a year in the decade after 2009 , significantly faster than the economy ( which be expect to grow at an Suggested Citation .  The committee estimate that finance the projected growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending alone would require an increase in total federal revenue ( from the recent historical average of about 18 .  For either approach to be successful , the traditional Medicare program would have to become fully and irrevocably accountable for it spending .

Another significant contributor to grow deficit be the increase in spending for Social Security ( mainly owe to the aging of the population ) and for Medicare and the other major health care program ( because of rise health care cost per person and , to a less degree , the aging of the population ) .  After 2031 , revenue continue to rise—but not a fast a the growth in spending .

But even the most aggressive tax hike on the rich would make only a small dent in the long-term budget deficit , and they would significantly harm the economy .  Before consider any new tax , lawmaker should first reduce federal spending benefit for high-income family .  This bipartisan strategy would achieve both the redistributive goal of the left and the spending restraint goal of the right .  Such upper-income spending cut have several advantage over new tax .  DOWNLOAD PDF IntroductionAs structural budget deficit grow to trillion of dollar and politician promise even more spending , tax the rich have become a popular solution to finance expanded government .  But large tax increase on high earner not only be insufficient to close much of these budget gap ; they would also reduce economic growth and kill job .  [ 3 ] Nearly all this debt will result from general revenue transfer into the Social Security and Medicare system to close their widening shortfall , as well a the added interest cost on the national debt create by these shortfall .
***** Washington run $ 6 trillion in deficit during the past two year of pandemic and recession , and be project to run $ 12 trillion in baseline deficit over the next decade .  9 trillion “ stimulus ” bill enact in March , a $ 550 billion infrastructure bill that pass the Senate , the president ’ s discretionary spending surge that would increase the baseline by $ 1 trillion over the decade , and a reconciliation bill that can borrow up to $ 1 .  Debt dove point out that the current federal debt burden of 100 percent of GDP have not severely damage the economy or bring escalate interest rate .  Indeed , many of those who assert that Congress can afford to enact $ 6 trillion in new borrowing be fail to account for a historic debt surge that be already come a part of the long-term budget baseline .  Over the next three decade , the federal government be project by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) to run budget deficit of $ 112 trillion , push the national debt past 200 percent of GDP .  By the end of this period , the annual budget deficit be project to reach 13 .  At that point , interest on the national debt would be the large federal expenditure , consume nearly half of all tax revenue .  These reform could keep Social Security and Medicare from drive unsustainable deficit , and ultimately maintain fiscal space for other priority .
***** Net Interest Outlays Under Various Interest Rate Scenarios At a Glance Over the past 10 year , the federal government ’ s net interest cost have grow by about 25 percent relative to the size of the economy a represent by gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  In the federal budget , the category of spend call net interest comprise the government ’ s interest payment on debt hold by the public , offset by certain type of interest income that the government receive .  Some of those payment and receipt be intragovernmental transaction on account that be not relate to the public debt and have no effect on the overall federal budget .  3 percent of total federal spending .  In CBO ’ s most recent projection , the cumulative deficit from 2021 through 2030 total nearly $ 13 trillion .  3 percent of total spending .  The interest the government pay on debt hold by the public have remain low a a percentage of GDP , even though that debt have rise to historically high level .  Interest cost be project to grow steadily a interest rate rise and the size of the debt increase .  Although the federal government have increase it borrow from the public by $ 12 trillion ( or roughly 130 percent ) in the past 10 year , net annual outlay for interest rise by $ 149 billion ( or roughly 75 percent ) because interest rate fell to historically low level .  As rates—and the government ’ s cost of borrowing—increase or decrease , they would raise or low the government ’ s cost of roll over it exist debt and borrowing to finance new deficit .  Interest rate on government security that be high than CBO project would raise outlay for interest on new borrowing and on debt that need to be refinance .
***** •The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance ( OASI ) Trust Fund , which pay retirement and survivor benefit , will be able to pay schedule benefit on a timely basis until 2033 , one year earlier than report last year .  The hypothetical combine OASI and DI fund would be able to pay schedule benefit on a timely basis until 2034 , one year earlier than report last year .  At that time , the fund 's reserve will become depleted and continuing total program income will be sufficient to pay 91 percent of total scheduled benefit .  SMI be adequately finance into the indefinite future because current law provide financing from general revenue and beneficiary premium each year to meet the next year 's expect cost .  •The Trustees be include in the report for the fifth consecutive year a determination of project excess general revenue Medicare funding , a be require by law whenever annual tax and premium revenue of the combine Medicare fund will be below 55 percent of project combine annual outlay within the next seven fiscal year .  Key Changes Since Last Year The long-range 75-year actuarial deficit of the combined OASI and DI trust fund increase from 3 .  The long-range 75-year actuarial deficit of the HI Trust Fund increase from 0 .  24 COVID-19 spending assumption .  As Medicare cost grows over time , general revenue and beneficiary premium will play an increase role in finance the program .
***** The President propose to use about two-thirds of the projected budget surplus over the next 15 year to reduce publicly hold debt .  These new Treasury security would constitute a new unearned claim on general fund for the HI program -- a marked break with the payroll tax-based financing structure of the program .

The President propose to use about two-thirds of the projected budget surplus over the next 15 year to reduce publicly hold debt .  These new Treasury security would constitute a new unearned claim on general fund for the HI program -- a marked break with the payroll tax-based financing structure of the program .  It would significantly reduce debt hold by the public from current level , thereby also reduce net interest cost , raise national saving , and contribute to future economic growth .  It be important to note , however , that these new Treasury security would constitute a new unearned claim on general fund for the HI program -- a marked break with the payroll tax-based financing structure of the program .  ( 1 ) current fiscal policy decision can help expand the future capacity of our economy by increase national saving and investment , ( 2 ) engaging in substantive reform of retirement and health program can reduce future claim , ( 3 ) by act now , we have the opportunity of phase in change to Social Security and Medicare program over a sufficient period of time to enable our citizen to adjust , and ( 4 ) failure to achieve need reform in the Social Security and Medicare program will drive future spending to level that will eventually squeeze out most or all discretionary spending , include national defense spending .  Unlike Social Security , Medicare 's HI program have be experience a cash flow deficit since 1992current payroll tax and other revenue have be insufficient to cover benefit payment and program expense .  Stated differently , the bleeding of the HI trust fund have already start base on the program 's annual cash flow deficit .  , with no change in tax or spending policythis would happen without credit additional security to either the Social Security or Medicare trust fund .
***** current employer and employee contribute tax that fund benefit to retire worker and survivor in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance ( OASI ) program , as well a disabled worker and their family under the Disability Insurance ( DI ) program .  Today , Social Security be the large program in the federal budget and typically make up almost one-quarter of total federal spending .  The program provide benefit to nearly 65 million beneficiary , or about 20 percent of the American population .  Retired worker account for 71 percent of the program ’ s beneficiary .  Disability benefit , on the other hand , be pay to people who can not work due to a medical condition that be expect to persist for at least one year or result in death ; Social Security do not grant benefit to individual with partial or short-term disability .  As Social Security run those cash deficit , the trust fund will “ redeem ” their Treasury security and the Treasury will have to borrow fund from the public to cover the shortfall .

***** A Win for Bipartisanship Read BPC 's Statement on the Passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Deficit Tracker BPC ’ s economic policy team analyzes the government ’ s run budget deficit and update the Deficit Tracker every month .  Nov 15 , 2021 Large and sustain federal budget deficit be harmful to the fiscal health of the United States .  Even in time of economic growth , the federal government run large and grow budget deficit , near $ 1 trillion per year .  Now that policymakers be enact necessary , emergency measure to combat the crisis , federal budget deficit be escalate to level not see since World War II .  BPC ’ s economic policy team analyzes the government ’ s run budget deficit and update the Deficit Tracker every month .  October 2021 The Congressional Budget Office estimate that the federal government run a deficit of $ 167 billion in October , the first month of fiscal year 2022 .  This deficit be the difference between an estimate $ 285 billion in revenue and $ 451 billion in outlay .  October ’ s deficit be 41 % ( $ 117 billion ) less than the $ 284 billion deficit record in October 2020 , the first month of FY 2021 .  A 20 % year-over-year upswing in revenue due to high individual income and payroll tax , complement by a reduction in outlay ( 13 % low ) from wan COVID-19 relief spending this year , drive the year-over-year deficit decline .  Fiscal Year 2021 in Review The federal government run a deficit of $ 2 .  8 trillion in spending .  Meanwhile , the American Rescue Plan will exempt some unemployment benefit from taxation , so a significant share of tax already collect on these benefit will be refund .
***** As a result of the federal government 's enormous debt and deficit , substantial inflation could break out in America in the next few year .  If people become convince that our government will end up print money to cover intractable deficit , they will see inflation in the future and so will try to get rid of dollar today drive up the price of good , service , and eventually wage across the entire economy .  Most analyst today even those who do worry about inflation ignore the direct link between debt , loom deficit , and inflation .  They assume that the government will always have the fiscal resource to back up any monetary policy to , for example , issue bond back by tax revenue that can soak up any excess money in the economy .  While the assumption of fiscal solvency may have make sense in America during most of the post-war era , the size of the government 's debt and unsustainable future deficit now put u in an unfamiliar danger zone one beyond the realm of conventional American macroeconomic idea .  To Bernanke , cost , slack , and expectation drive inflation and not the money supply , or the national debt .  The Fed can instantly raise the interest rate on reserve , thereby in effect turn reserve from `` cash `` that pay no interest to `` overnight , floating-rate government debt .  And like the Keynesians , the monetarist do not consider our deficit and debt when they think about inflation .  Their formal theory , like the Keynesian one , assume in footnote that the government be solvent , so there be never pressure for the Fed to monetize intractable deficit .  But what if our huge debt and loom deficit mean that the fiscal backing for monetary policy be about to become unglued ? .  Annual deficit be now run about $ 1 .  Each of these commitment could suddenly dump massive new debt onto the federal Treasury , and could be the trigger for the kind of `` run on the dollar `` explain here .  At some point , the government must soak up extra dollar ( beyond what people be willing to hold to make transaction ) with tax revenue great than spending that be , by run a surplus .
***** Such proposal , which offer universal coverage of virtually all medical service with no meaningful premium or cost sharing , would shift nearly all private health spending to the public sector and thus significantly increase federal spending .  policymakers would likely adopt a combination of approach that be equivalent to a 32 percent payroll tax , 25 percent income surtax , 42 percent value-added tax ( VAT ) , a $ 7,500 per caput mandatory public premium , double all income tax rate , reduce non-health spending by 80 percent , or increase debt 105 percent of GDP .  3 percent in 2030 , deficit financing it would reduce GDP by 5 .  Most financing option would be more progressive than new spending but have different distributional implication within and between income group .  A mandatory public premium could be modestly regressive relative to the additional spending .  Significant increase in tax rate from these option could lift the top rate to near or above the revenue-maximizing level , leave little capacity to raise future revenue for other important purpose .  Policymakers should carefully consider and weigh the relative cost and benefit of these consequence in decide how much to expand federal health spending and how to finance the cost associate with do so .  In combination with eliminate all premium and cost sharing , this alone could cost the federal government $ 2 trillion per year .  Options for Financing Medicare for All Though most of the federal cost of Medicare for All would come from replace private spending with public spending , these cost would nonetheless need to be finance through high tax , low spending , more borrowing , or some combination of the three .
***** My Medicare for All plan give everyone good insurance and cut their health care cost to nearly zero - without increase middle-class tax one penny .  That ’ s how much an average family of four with employer-sponsored insurance personally spend per year on employee premium contribution and out-of-pocket cost in 2018 .  It put $ 11 trillion back in the pocket of American family , and doesn ’ t raise tax on the middle class by even a cent .  Where be the hundred of million be spend so that people who be try to balance a budget around rise health care premium and grow deductible and copays can make their voice hear in Washington ? .  And we make up the difference with targeted spending cut , new tax on giant corporation and the rich 1 % of Americans , and by crack down on tax evasion and fraud .  Not one penny in middle-class tax increase .  or , for about the same amount of money , a new system that drive down overall health cost and , on average , relieve the typical middle class family of $ 12,400 in insurance premium and other related health care cost .  Every candidate who oppose my long-term goal of Medicare for All should put forward their own plan to cover everyone , without cost the country anything more in health care spending , and while put $ 11 trillion back in the pocket of the American people by eliminate premium and virtually eliminate out-of-pocket cost .  And every candidate who oppose my long-term goal of Medicare for All should put forward their own plan to make sure every single person in America can get high-quality health care and win ’ t go break - and fully explain how they intend to pay for it .
***** Following the financial crisis , the budget deficit reach 10 % of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2009 and 9 % of GDP in 2010 , a level that can not be sustain in the long run .  While entitlement spending make little contribution to current budget deficit , the retirement of the baby boomer , rise life expectancy , and the rise cost of medical care result in projection of large and grow budget deficit over the next several decade .  Without any corresponding rise in revenue , this spending path would maintain unsustainably large and persistent budget deficit , which would push up interest rate and the trade deficit , crowd out private investment spending , and ultimately cause fiscal crisis .  National saving can be increase by reduce the budget deficit .  But if the budget saving be subsequently offset by new spending or tax cut , the government ’ s ability to finance future benefit will not have improve .  Individual account finance by increase the budget deficit would not increase national saving or reduce the government ’ s fiscal imbalance , and could exacerbate that imbalance over the 75-year projection .  Relatively small tax increase or benefit reduction could return Social Security to long-run solvency .  Restraining the growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending be more uncertain and difficult , however .  The projected increase in spending be drive more by medical spending outpace general spending increase than by demographic change .  If future medical spending grows more slowly than project , then the long-term budget outlook improve dramatically .  From a government-wide perspective , Social Security or Medicare trust fund asset can not help finance future benefit because they be redeem with general revenue at a time when the overall budget be in deficit .  Overall , current budget deficit negate the system ’ s limit exist prefunding , exacerbate the future fiscal shortfall .  Historical and Projected Federal Debt a a Share of GDP Summary Following the financial crisis , the budget deficit reach 10 % of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2009 and 9 % of GDP in 2010 , a level that can not be sustain in the long run .  From a government-wide perspective , Social Security or Medicare trust fund asset can not help finance future benefit because they be redeem with general revenue at a time when the overall budget be in deficit .  Instead , they be be use to support the government 's current fiscal stance , in which revenue and other outlay be set at a level where they be in deficit .

In 2017 , for the first time after 30 year of economic reform , the CPV adopt a separate resolution on boost the development of the private sector , acknowledge it to be an “ important drive force of the socialist-oriented market economy .  In 1986 , the Vietnam Communist Party ’ s sixth party congress formally adopt an economic reform program ( know a Đổi Mới ) after allow some experiment at the local level .  The reform pave the way for a market economy to develop , the nation ’ s deep integration into the region and the world through join such institution a ASEAN and WTO , expansion of bilateral relation with country around the world and normalization of relationship with former foe , include China and the United States .

***** 1979-1984 With the Soviet Union ’ s achievement of strategic nuclear parity with the United States in the early 1970s , arm control have become a central policy concern .  Negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear force ( INF ) start under the aegis of President Jimmy Carter and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev follow Soviet deployment of SS-20s , multiwarhead ballistic missile target on Western Europe , in 1976 .  Defense Ministers meeting in December 1979—in which I participate a State ’ s European Bureau representative—NATO have agree on a two-track policy .  The Alliance would offer negotiation with the Soviet Union to limit deployment of intermediate-range missile but would also prepare to deploy such missile in the territory of European alliance member if agreement could not be reach with Moscow .  The idea appeal to Reagan , and the zero option become the position present to Moscow by the Reagan administration in November 1981 , contrary to the advice of Reagan ’ s first Secretary of State , Alexander Haig .  This display of NATO solidarity must have add to the feeling in Moscow that their government lack the clout their people expect it to have .  “ People of the Soviet Union , there be only one sane policy , for your country and mine , to preserve our civilization in this modern age .
***** that we lack the weapon to deter a Russian nuclear strike .  should it approve the Trump administration ’ s request for new , small , more usable nuclear weapon ? .  These so-called “ low-yield ” nuclear weapon be a gateway to a nuclear catastrophe .  There be a false narrative in Washington that the United States have a “ gap ” in it ability to deter the use of nuclear weapon by Russia .  Administration official allege that Moscow believe that an American president would not respond to Russian use of “ tactical , ” or lower-yield , nuclear weapon since his only option include “ strategic , ” or high-yield , one .  Since our president would not want to start an all-out nuclear war , he would be “ self-deterred ” from use big nuke , the logic go , and Moscow would have a path to use small nuke that we could not block .

Every now and then , Lucy Duncan think about how the diplomatic fight against nuclear proliferation have shadow her work life .  Long before Ms Duncan first join the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade even when she be a kid grow up in Dunedin in the 1970s the political air be heavy with nuclear fallout in the wake of Labour prime minister Norman Kirk dispatch a frigate with one of his minister on board to protest against French nuclear test at Mururoa atoll .  The move put the wind in the sail of the anti-nuclear movement and what would become the countrys signature foreign policy .  The new administration have be elect on a historic pledge to change the way New Zealand do business with the nuclear power .  A decade on , Ms Duncan head to the United Nations centre in Europe and the United States for a variety of role relate to nuclear disarmament and arm control negotiation even a New Zealand revive it major anti-nuclear case against France at the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) .  Today , a the New Zealand ambassador to Colombia , she see how the country policy continue to reverberate with New Zealands trading partner in Latin America .

An Increasingly Threatening Global Environment The nuclear threat environment have change drastically from a stability paradigm base on mutually assure destruction involve the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War to a multipolar nuclear threat environment that present complex challenge .  nuclear force face three great challenge .  Aging nuclear warhead , their associate delivery system , and system for their command and control ; An aging and crumble nuclear weapon infrastructure ; and An age workforce .  The United States must fully recapitalize all three leg ( land , air , and sea ) of the nuclear triad include the system for nuclear command and control while also conduct timely and cost-efficient warhead life-extension programs—all while operate under the current nuclear test moratorium .  Despite these challenge , the United States must ensure that it nuclear capability be sufficient to address the rise nuclear threat for the decade to come .  For the first time in history , the United States must deter two nuclear peers—Russia and China—while contend with a large number of nuclear weapon state .  Russia be engage in an aggressive nuclear buildup , have add several new nuclear system to it arsenal since 2010 .  The United States be only begin to modernize it exist nuclear system , but Russia ’ s modernization effort be about 86 percent complete .  Instead , the United States have largely elect to extend the life of age nuclear warhead base on design from the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s that be in the stockpile when the Cold War end .

The president maintain that the world be “ vastly different ” than when the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty enter into force in 1972 , hold that more country either have or be seek nuclear , biological , and chemical weapon , leave the United States vulnerable to attack or blackmail .  Bush contend that in this new world , deterrence “ be no longer enough ” and that the United States would have to “ move beyond the constraint of the 30-year-old ABM Treaty ” and build missile defense to protect itself .  ” The president say that the new framework he wish to develop would “ encourage ” cut in nuclear weapon and that he be “ commit to achieve a credible deterrent with the low possible number of nuclear weapon consistent with our national security need .  ” Bush pledge to dispatch team of high-level representative to friend and ally around the globe to discuss his plan , while say Washington would also consult with Russia , China , and “ other interested party .  ” The Democratic leadership respond the next day , question the urgency of the missile threat , the feasibility of an effective missile defense , and the notion that nuclear weapon be not enough to deter “ rogue state .

Mobile US ICBM program be halted—as be the AGM-131 nuclear short-range attack missile .  If we and the Soviet leader take the right steps—some on our own , some on their own , some together—we can dramatically shrink the arsenal of the world ’ s nuclear weapon , say Bush in his address .  He say the USSR would match the US on removal and dismantlement of tactical nuclear weapon , while take 500 missile off alert and cancel some strategic modernization program .  After the Soviet Union collapse at the end of 1991 , new Russian President Boris Yeltsin vow to live up to Gorbachev ’ s nuclear commitment , and even to expand upon them .  He say Russia would end far development of nuclear sea-launched cruise missile , for example , and destroy it exist SLCM stock .  The US initiative be not contingent on a Soviet response , and the Bush Administration do not consult with Soviet leadership prior to it public announcement , but many hop that the US initiative would provide President Gorbachev with the incentive to take similar step to withdraw and eliminate many of his nation ’ s nonstrategic nuclear weapon , write Woolf .

***** Still others be in conflict with administration program that actually further the spread of nuclear weapon .  last fall , I propose a new Security Council resolution require all state to criminalize proliferation , enact strict export control , and secure all sensitive material within their border .  And when they do , America stand ready to help other government to draft and enforce the new law that will help u deal with proliferation .  For example , the agency set the amount of weapon-usable material require to make a nuclear bomb at 8 kilogram of plutonium or 25 kilogram of highly enriched uranium .  One-kiloton yield pure-fission nuclear weapon can be make with amount that be approximately eight time small than the IAEA threshold .  Nunn-Lugar fund be not be use to `` dismantle and destroy `` Russian nuclear weapon ( a oppose to missile silo and obsolete strategic bomber and submarine ) .  Despite year of cooperation , the United States still have no firm idea of how many and which type of Russian nuclear warhead and bomb have be dismantle .

In the age of increasingly capable conventional munition , cyber warfare and autonomous robot , be nuclear weapon not just a relic of the Cold War that have now cease to be relevant ? .  At a time when discussion of lethal autonomous weapon , drone swarm and the weaponisation of out space make modern warfare seem like a sci-fi thriller , nuclear weapon can seem a retro a a Sony Walkman or landline telephone .  And yet , nuclear-armed nation such a Russia and China be once again invest heavily to create more sophisticated and diverse nuclear arsenal , North Korea be continue it nuclear expansion apace , and Iran be once again make headline for it nuclear development .  For over 70 year , both the national arsenal of the NATO nuclear weapon state .  and the US nuclear weapon forward deploy in Europe have provide deterrence for the Alliance and reassurance for Allies .  NATO head of state and government have repeatedly affirm that NATO be a nuclear alliance and will remain so a long a nuclear weapon exist .
***** Daryl Kimball , executive director ; Kingston Reif , director for disarmament and threat reduction policy Over the past five decade , American and Soviet/Russian leader have use a progression of bilateral agreement and other measure to limit and reduce their substantial nuclear warhead and strategic missile and bomber arsenal .  Under the Interim Agreement , both side pledge not to construct new ICBM silo , not to increase the size of exist ICBM silo “ significantly , ” and cap the number of SLBM launch tube and SLBM-carrying submarine .  and Soviet ICBM , SLBM , and strategic bomber-based nuclear force to 2,250 delivery vehicle ( define a an ICBM silo , a SLBM launch tube , or a heavy bomber ) and place a variety of other restriction on deployed strategic nuclear force .  However , on May 26 , 1986 , President Ronald Reagan say that future decision on strategic nuclear force would be base on the threat pose by Soviet force and not on `` a flawed SALT II Treaty .  The agreement ’ s entry into force be delay for several year because of the collapse of the Soviet Union and ensue effort to denuclearize Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Belarus by return their nuclear weapon to Russia and make them party to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and START I agreement .

Although it continue many long-standing policy and program , it also introduce new element into both U .  nuclear posture to highlight area of change and area of continuity .  During the Cold War , the United States seek to deter the Soviet Union and it ally from attack the United States and it ally by convince the Soviet Union that any level of conflict could escalate into a nuclear exchange and , in that exchange , the United States would plan to destroy the full range of value target in the Soviet Union .  nuclear war plan due to their alliance with the Soviet Union .  After the Cold War , the United States maintain a substantial nuclear arsenal to deter potential threat from Russia .  It would not forswear the first use of nuclear weapon in conflict with other nation , such a those arm with chemical or biological weapon , and form contingency plan for such conflict .  The Bush Administration have emphasize that the United States and Russia be no long enemy and that the United States will no longer plan or size it nuclear force to deter a “ Russian threat .  ” Instead , the United States will maintain a nuclear arsenal with the capability need to counter capability of any potential adversary , focus on “ how we will fight ” rather than “ who we will fight .  nuclear weapon will combine with missile defense , conventional weapon , and a responsive infrastructure in seek to assure U .

***** But with Iran and North Korea grow their nuclear weapon program , a rapid acceleration in China , and a flagging U .  As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy , you serve a Policy Director of the Obama administration 's Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) .  Every new administration conduct a review of national security strategy .  An NPR look at the security environment ; it look at declaratory policy , which be the thing the president say about when he or she might or would n't ever use nuclear weapon ; it look at force and capability and their long-term modernization ; and it look at strategy to reduce nuclear dangersarms control , non-proliferation , disarmament .  It 's important for every incoming administration to do it homework on this stuff , because you 're not compel to on the campaign trail , and if you 're the out-of-power party , you 're in a position to criticize but not really to make policy .  Each administration have approach this review task differently .  Sometimes the incoming president have give a big speech , a President Obama do in Prague in April 2009 , lay out his nuclear ambition .
***** The Biden administration see arm control a a tool that can advance security and stability .  It will seek to engage Russia on further nuclear arm reduction and other measure .  Arms control in the 2020s will reflect continuity with early efforts—nuclear arm reduction will remain a bilateral matter between Washington and Moscow—but also contain new element .  Start with Strategic Stability Donald Trump be the first American president in 50 year to reach no agreement in the area of nuclear weapon .  President Biden see arm control a an important policy tool .  His administration plan to do more .  On February 3 , Secretary of State Blinken say Washington would “ pursue with the Russian Federation , in consultation with Congress and US ally and partner , arm control that address all of it nuclear weapon .  The administration need to get it team in place .

In these discussion , it be difficult to find concept that be more commonly usedand abusedthan strategic stability and nuclear deterrence .
***** While the Bush administration view nuclear weapon a central to US security , it have a large vision of US military dominance a a principal mean for serve US national security interest .  The administration have show scant concern for US treaty obligation , particularly in the area of arm control .  Most prominently , the administration have disavow the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty , argue it be no longer relevant in a post-Cold War environment .  The US Nuclear Posture Review The clear statement of US nuclear policy can be find in the administration ’ s Nuclear Posture Review Report , a classified document mandate by Congress , which be leak to the press in March 2002 .  This report lay out a “ New Triad , ” compose of offensive strike system ( nuclear and non-nuclear ) , defense ( active and passive ) , and a revitalized defense infrastructure to meet emerging threat .  The old strategic triad of land-based missile , sea-based missile and long-range bomber now fit into the nuclear branch of the New Triad ’ s offensive strike system .  The Nuclear Posture Review state , “ Nuclear weapon play a critical role in the defense capability of the United States , it ally and friend .  These nuclear capability posse unique property that give the United States option to hold at risk class of target [ that be ] important strategic and political objective .  ” This be an extraordinary admission of the benefit that US leader attribute to nuclear weapon in US defense policy , benefit that they be clearly reserve for themselves and a small group of other nuclear weapon state .  As a candidate , Bush also promote development and deployment of a National Missile Defense to protect the United States against nuclear attack by so-called rogue state , a proposal that would have be prohibit under the ABM Treaty .  The response of the Bush administration be that it have no problem with a build-up of Chinese nuclear force capable of threaten US territory since the US missile defense system be aim at “ rogue ” nation and not at China .  Not only have the Bush administration withdrawn from the ABM Treaty , the President have make it clear that he do not intend to send the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty back to the Senate for ratification .  Nor have it show good faith in fulfil the 2000 NPT Review Conference ’ s 13 Practical Steps for Nuclear Disarmament , include pursue the promised “ unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapon state to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals… .  The Logic of War Against Iraq The Bush administration have premise it case for war against Iraq on the need for regime change , primarily because Saddam Hussein may be try to develop weapon of mass destruction , include nuclear weapon .
***** President Biden pledge a new approach a pressure mount along the boundary .  Walter Pincus discuss nuclear security , the test history of nuclear weapon , and the potential fallout of use nuclear weapon in war .  Task Force Report Analysis and policy prescription of major foreign policy issue face the United States , develop through private deliberation among a diverse and distinguish group of expert .  In his April 5 Prague speech , President Obama call for the United States to lead international effort toward a world free of nuclear weapon .  A new Council on Foreign Relations-sponsored Independent Task Force report , co-chaired by former secretary of defense William J .  Perry and former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft , say that while `` the geopolitical condition that would permit the global elimination of nuclear weapon do not currently exist , `` step can be take now to diminish the danger of nuclear proliferation and nuclear use .  Nuclear Weapons Policy , focus on near-term policy to reduce nuclear weapon to the low possible level consistent with maintain a credible deterrent , while also ensure that the U .  nuclear arsenal be safe , secure , and reliable for as long a it be need .
***** Those concern be about , first , the capacity of the United States to verify compliance ; second , the extent to which other country could improve their nuclear-weapon capability through nuclear test that be below the threshold of detection ; and , third , the capacity of the United States to maintain confidence in the safety and reliability of it exist stockpile of nuclear weapon without conduct periodic nuclear test .  capability to verify a CTBT be good -- indeed good than be generally suppose .  Wherever conduct and in any environment -- whether in the atmosphere , in the ocean , underground , or in space -- nuclear test down to a yield of 1 or 2 kiloton , and in many circumstance less , would be highly likely to be detect .  With respect to the second issue , we find that clandestine nuclear test below the threshold of detectability be more difficult to accomplish than have sometimes be suppose .  Certain type of simple and relatively heavy and inefficient nuclear weapon can be develop without any nuclear testing at all .
***** Yes , the role of nuclear weapon .  We be see a rise of some significant investment in nuclear system .  But it ’ s under his tenure that the committee have develop new vigor and new energy .  And we be really thrill to have you here with u , Chairman Smith , to talk through a whole range of nuclear issue .  Well , my understanding be the bill fully authorize funding for the Trump administration ’ s request for nuclear-modernization funding , include the ground-based strategic deterrent , the replacement for our current land leg of the nuclear triad .  You know , a we move squarely into the bow-wave stage of nuclear modernization , what be your take on the future of the triad a the basis for our nuclear posture ? .  Well , I think there ’ s a couple of broad way to separate out this issue a we move into the Biden administration .  You know , first of all , there be considerable disagreement within the Democratic Party about the future of what our , you know , military national-security policy ought to be , go forward .  You know , a be point out , I mean , the Obama administration do a lot more drone strike than the Bush administration do .  They be much more active in , you know , in do mission against terrorist in far-flung place of the world even than the Bush administration , and then on the size of the defense budget , on the degree to which .  And then that come down to the nuclear issue a be part of that , and a general feeling that the size of the U .
***** In announce the Biden administration ’ s intent to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) for another five year , Secretary of State Anthony Blinkin offer a hint .  He note that the next negotiation must include all of Russian and American nuclear weapon , not just the long-range strategic system limit by New START .  According to one recent commentary , “ limit defense would therefore be an essential first step to constrain the nuclear arm race .  After all , the Russian side never miss an opportunity to register it opposition to missile defense anytime arm control be mention or when the United States deploy a new missile defense system at home or abroad .  Do limit on missile defense secure restraint on offensive nuclear force ? .  Does the United States really have to limit it homeland missile defenses a a precursor to nuclear force reduction ? .  In fact , Moscow and Washington have agree to significant nuclear arm reduction even a the United States have pursue protection of it homeland from ballistic missile threat .
***** START II Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Strategic Offensive Reductions ( START II ) START II complement START I by attempt to establish further limit on strategic nuclear weapon for each party .  By the end of Phase I , the United States and Russia be to reduce their total deploy strategic nuclear warhead to 3,800-4,250 , include no more than 2,160 warhead deploy on submarine-launched ballistic missile ( SLBMs ) , no more than 650 on heavy intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBMs ) , and no more than 1,700-1,750 on SLBMs .  By the end of Phase II , each Partys total number of deployed strategic nuclear warhead be not to exceed 3,000-3,500 .  Each side be also allow to download 105 ICBMs by up to five warhead per missile .  In contrast to START I , START II calculate nuclear warhead attribute to heavy bomber by count the number of warhead each heavy bomber be actually capable of carry .  Each side be to convert such bomber to a nuclear role follow a three-month notification but be not to subsequently reconvert them to a conventional role .  In addition , START II provide for exhibition and inspection to observe the number of nuclear weapon for which heavy bomber be actually equip and their relevant observable difference .

An economic and national security imperative Margaret Jackson , Zachary Strauss In advance of the annual UN Climate Summit in Glasgow this November , the United States must raise it clean energy and climate ambition and reassert global climate leadership .  Amidst a global energy transition , the demand , financial , and social future of oil and gas company be increasingly in question .  However , even with these obstacle , oil and gas remain an important part of the energy mix , especially in develop region .  In the United States , India , and China—the three large greenhouse gas emitters—natural gas in particular have the potential to remain an integral component of the low carbon energy transition for decade to come , depend on the policy mechanism and technology in place .  The challenge for the oil and gas industry be to both engage and adapt to a changing policy and investment landscape , but also to evolve in way which don ’ t simply support but contribute and perhaps even lead effort to decarbonize the energy system .  In addition to disincentive , many government be encourage the use of substitute technology and fuel , especially renewable energy .

But the concentrated energy that they provide have prove hard to replace .  Until that moment , I hadn ’ t think enough about how my experience and background give me a clear view than many on the promise and challenge of move to a clean energy system .  I have gain a wide-angle view of the energy industry a I ’ ve move through my career , work in government and in consult — for both oil and gas and clean energy client — and then move into the think tank world .  To deal with the challenge of climate change , we must start by understand the fossil fuel system — namely how energy be produce and use .  Although fossil fuel company be politically powerful , in the United States and around the world , their lobbying prowess be not the key reason that their fuel dominate the global energy system .  Likewise , the transition to an all-renewable energy system be not a simple task .  Throughout history , humanity ’ s energy use have move toward more concentrated , convenient , and flexible form of energy .

So the reality of the energy world today—which be 75 percent of emission be energy—is not anything close to net zero by 2050 .  have a pledge to get to a 50 to 52 percent reduction in emission by 2030 , and look at how thing be work or not work in Washington and make your own judgment about how likely it be that we ’ ll put in place the set of policy that would be require to get to that ambitious level of decarbonization by 2030 .

That change help shore up the financial health of the FHA ’ s mortgage insurance fund —but come at a real cost to homeowner , who would have save an average of $ 500 a year if the Obama-era plan have stay in place .  Again and again , Trump have take the stage to an adoring crowd and declare victory on some issue , or announce lavish new promise , without any real result or plan to back them up .  Meanwhile , very steadily , and almost totally separately from Trump ’ s speech and tweetstorms , his administration have be usher in a new conservative era of government—taking specific aim at Obama-era rule , and broad aim at the big regulatory mission of government .

***** And I appreciate his willingness to serve in a position of this magnitude , especially at this particularly crucial time .  When Obamacare be push through on a series of party-line vote , Republicans in Congress warn that the new health-care law basically would harm patient , family , and business .  Not to put too fine a point on it , but we be right .  And the next HHS Secretary will play a pivotal role a we work to repeal Obamacare and replace it with patient-centered reform that will actually address cost , among other thing .  It be no exaggeration to say that HHS touch more of the U .  Perhaps the Healthcare Leadership Council , represent the broad swath of health-care provider , say it best in state that , quote , `` It be difficult to imagine anyone more capable of serve this Nation a the Secretary of HHS than Congressman Tom Price .  At least that appear to be the case , since none of those who say they oppose Dr .  My Democratic friend have take this approach with almost all of President Trump 's Cabinet nominee , a Senate Democrats ' unprecedented effort to delay and derail the confirmation process and apply a radically new set of confirmation standard have continue unabated .  To that point , let me say this .  In fact , from time to time I have take lump in some conservative circle for work closely with my Democratic colleague .  I raise all of this today so that people can know I be serious when I say that I be worry about what my colleague on the minority side be do to the Senate a an institution .
***** Rather than take the federal money to expand Medicaid , Walker adopt a unique plan that eliminate Medicaid coverage for those recipient who make more than the federal poverty level ( mostly parent ) , thus make room for people make less than that ( mostly adult without child ) .  As to the “ whim of Washington , ” the recent TrumpRyan proposal to replace Obamacare would have make insurance purchase through the exchange unaffordable to many people just above the poverty line , particularly to those in their 50 or 60 .  The foregone fund could have help reduce program cut or even reduce Wisconsin tax .  Trump to do the right thing but be quick to say that they didn ’ t really know what he would do , and be worry about what would come next .  They say their coverage be hopelessly complex .  Those with marketplace insurance — for which they be eligible for subsidy — saw Medicaid a a much good deal than their insurance and be resentful that people with income low than theirs could get it .
***** Medicare , the nation ’ s health insurance program for adult age 65 and over and non-elderly people with permanent disability , be a key part of these discussion , principally because the program account for 15 percent of the Federal budget and program spending be rise a a share of the budget and the nation ’ s gross domestic product .  Important difference be reflect in the various proposal in term of the magnitude and scope of propose change and how program saving would be achieve .  Over the next decade , Medicare be project to grow more slowly than private health care spending on a per caput basis , but the retirement of the Baby Boom generation and rise health care cost pose fiscal challenge for the nation .  Of note , this report do not attempt—nor be it intended—to endorse or recommend a specific set of Medicare program change or reach a specific target for save .  For example , one approach would leave the current program structure largely intact but make modification to feature of it , for example , by adjust exist payment rule for provider and plan or raise beneficiary cost-sharing requirement for specific service .  Another approach would attempt to leverage Medicare ’ s significant role in the health care marketplace to create strong incentive to promote value over volume , for example , by accelerate the implementation of delivery system reform , promote model of care that improve the management of care for high-cost , high-need beneficiary , and introduce new mechanism to constrain excess payment and utilization .  And yet another approach would change the fundamental structure of Medicare from a defined benefit program to one that instead provide an entitlement to a government contribution for the purchase of coverage .  Each of these pathway could accommodate some specific saving and revenue option for Medicare that have be discuss , include raise the age of eligibility , increase the payroll tax or raise other revenue , and cap annual program spending .  These expert be very generous with their thought , idea , and time , for which we be extremely thankful .  Medicare be a Federal entitlement program that provide a guaranteed set of benefit to all Americans who meet the basic eligibility requirement , without regard to medical history , income , or asset .  Studies conduct prior to enactment of the ACA estimate that the number of uninsured 65- and 66-year-old adult would increase if the Medicare eligibility age be raise , in the absence of reform that would provide old adult with access to affordable insurance , without pre-existing condition exclusion and other restriction ( Davidoff and Johnson 2008 ) .  If the Medicare eligibility age be increase to 67 , 65- and 66-year-olds would be eligible for income-based subsidy a long a they do not have an offer of coverage from an employer .  An increase in the Medicare eligibility age would result in high premium for those who remain on Medicare , because young and relatively low-cost 65- and 66-year-olds would no longer be in the Medicare risk pool ; high premium for young adult get private coverage through the health insurance exchange because have 65- and 66-year-olds in that risk pool would increase the average cost of exchange coverage ; high cost for employer , to the extent that some of those no longer eligible for Medicare would be cover instead under an employer plan ; and high Medicaid expenditures a some lower-income people age 65 and 66 would be eligible for coverage under that program .

***** The Federal Government improperly spend over $ 36 billion in the Medicaid program , give the program an improper payment rate of 10 percent .  Every decade since it be create , Medicaid have grow faster than our economy , a trend that the Congressional Budget Office project to continue under current law .  Unfortunately , Medicaid 's financial condition have worsen in the last decade because Obamacare create a new category of eligibility , working-age childless adult , and give States a huge financial incentive to cover these working-age individual over the traditional population , which be the disabled , the indigent , and the elderly poor .  For every working-age able-bodied adult who enroll , a State get 90 cent on the dollar , but just about 60 cent when it enroll a disabled individual .  So let me start by say we have very different view of health care and the role of Medicaid , and so I respectfully acknowledge that a we move forward .  But let me first say , where we have issue with eligibility and enrollment , we need to fix them .  But right now , the number one threat to Americans who qualify for or would like to enroll in Medicaid be , frankly , a court case currently before the Fifth Circuit Court actively support , unfortunately , by the Trump administration .  And everything be at stake here , include protection for people with preexist condition , coverage for preventative service like cancer screening , the ability for child to remain on their parent ' health plan until age 26 , and the entire Medicaid expansion that cover 17 million Americans .  The expansion create more than 30,000 new job and increased economic activity by $ 432 million in 2017 alone .  So I would suggest for million of Americans live in the States right now who be in what be call `` the coverage gap , `` that instead we should be focus on how they can in fact get expand Medicare as well .  Unfortunately , the court case and the coverage gap be not the only threat to Medicaid eligibility and enrollment right now , and I would ask , Mr .  And let me just read the first paragraph , which say .  This mean that they be able to make someone eligible for Medicaid on attestation of income alone , with the understand that they will check later .

Wrong decision in the 1980s condemn the nation to a decade of high deficit ; right one in the 1990s have liberate it from past budgetary misdeed .  Liquidating the deficit rank a one of the supreme budgetary accomplishment in American history .  In 1993 , the Office of Management and Budget project that the fiscal 1998 deficit would be $ 339 billion ; the Congressional Budget Office project $ 357 billion .  In both their five-year projection and their annual budget estimate , OMB and CBO persistently overestimate the deficit .  In 1993 , CBO project that policy then in place would yield cumulative deficit of $ 1 .  Spending Policies Although a cooperative economy make the budget surplus possible , the surplus would not have materialize if budget policy in the 1990s have repeat the mistake of the 1980s .  Almost a decade later , BEA remain in effect , and although it have not always be strictly enforce , it have help improve the budget condition .  But even in the absence of PAYGO , big deficit would probably have inhibit the president and Congress from establish new entitlement and impel them to seek saving in old one .  Tax Policy If the economy and spending change do not adequately account for the surplus , the only other place to look be on the revenue side of the budget .  Prudence in fiscal management can not ensure that surplus will persist , but it can guard against a return of runaway deficit .  Divided government have block Republican ambition for large tax cut and deter Democrats from big increase in social spending .

Why be the United States , with the world 's large economy , borrow heavily on international capital market -- rather than lending , a would seem more natural ? .  current account deficit and our consequent reliance on foreign credit have for economic performance in the United States and in our trading partner ? .  current account deficit require a global perspective that more fully take into account event outside the United States .  To be more specific , I will argue that over the past decade a combination of diverse force have create a significant increase in the global supply of save -- a global saving glut -- which help to explain both the increase in the U .  current account deficit and the relatively low level of long-term real interest rate in the world today .  However , a I will discuss , an important source of the global saving glut have be a remarkable reversal in the flow of credit to develop and emerging-market economy , a shift that have transform those economy from borrower on international capital market to large net lender .  national saving be the source of the current account deficit must be true at some level ; indeed , the statement be almost a tautology .  federal budget deficit today , and I disagree with the view , sometimes heard , that balance the federal budget by itself would largely defuse the current account issue .  Although I do not believe that plausible near-term change in the federal budget would eliminate the current account deficit , I should stress that reduce the federal budget deficit be still a good idea .  Moreover , there be other good reason to bring down the federal budget deficit , include the reduction of the debt obligation that will have to be service by taxpayer in the future .

***** Economic impact of expire tax cut and impend spending cut , and policy recommendation .  Economic impact of expire tax cut and impend spending cut , and policy recommendation The focus of economic policy debate have turn to what have be call the “ fiscal cliff ” —the impact of tax cut set to expire and spending cut due to take effect at the end of calendar year 2012 .  For various reason , “ fiscal cliff ” be a poor metaphor , most importantly because there be no single cliff but rather a series of separable tax and spending provision that can be extend or end .  Budget battle in the lame duck and beyond Given that the fiscal policy debate over the past few year have be misdirect , focus too much on project medium- and long-term deficit and too little on the immediate problem of joblessness , this concern about the fiscal obstacle course mark a return to sensible discussion .  If all of the tax increase and spending cut currently set to kick in at the beginning of next year actually take effect , the economy will surely reenter a recession .  However , avoid a contractionary turn in fiscal policy ( i .  , a decrease in the growth of economic output result from target small budget deficit through policy change ) in the near term do not require that Congress mechanically extend all of the tax cut set to expire and prevent all of the scheduled spending decrease from take effect .  Instead , the fiscal obstacle course just ahead should be take a an opportunity to reorient policy to provide the maximum boost to the economy and job in come year , and a a chance to discard those expire provision that be neither supportive of job in the near term nor economically useful in the long run .  Continuing certain provision , notably the upper-income Bush-era tax cut , would have negligible economic benefit but would sharply worsen the fiscal outlook over the next decade if continue indefinitely .  1 Expiration of other policy , especially those pa to provide near-term fiscal support to the still-weak economy , pose significant risk to economic growth .  Lastly , it be important to note that any fiscal headwind that arise from allow temporary tax cut to expire on schedule could be overcome at a fraction of the cost with more cost-effective , targeted fiscal support .  It be simply that the budget deficit would shrink too quickly—that be , public debt would stop rise fast enough—to maintain economic growth , let alone an adequate pace of growth to lower the unemployment rate .  This paper attribute the entirety of that interaction effect to the Bush-era tax cut .  Economic impact of the Bush-era tax cut Continuation of the Bush-era tax cut would have the large budgetary impact of the major component of the fiscal obstacle course but a relatively low impact on economic growth—even low than the collective impact of other annually renew budget policy that be not intend a fiscal stimulus .  1 percent of the budgetary impact of the Bush tax cut , but account for nearly half ( 47 .  As policymakers consider which of these tax cut to preserve while the economy remain depressed , from a macroeconomic perspective these find indicate that it surely make sense to work from the “ bottom-up .

***** Budgeting for the Next Generation Fiscal FactCheck Fiscal InstituteBetter Budget Process Initiative Health Savers Initiative SSDI Solutions Initiative Capitalism , Tech , & Economy American Health Care Initiative About UsBoard Members Staff Members Events Media Coverage Job Opportunities Request a Speaker Support Subscribe While policymakers be gear up to address tax reform this fall , some have advocate for abandon true reform and instead focus solely on tax cut .  To combat argument that such cut will balloon the national debt , tax cut advocate have argue that the cut could pay for themselves , largely through fast economic growth .  Advocates point to tax cut in 1981 and the early 2000s to make this case .  Tax cut don ’ t pay for themselves .  While well-designed tax cut may grow the economy ( often not as much a tax reform ) , there be no case in which they could grow the economy enough to be self-financing .  At best , tax cut can finance a fraction of their cost through fast growth .  There be no theoretical basis to suggest tax cut could be self-financing .  To do that , the economy would need to grow by $ 5 to $ 6 for every $ 1 of tax cut .  There be broad consensus among economic model that future tax cut win ’ t pay for themselves .  Some model find tax cut would be partially self-financing , while others find the economic feedback would actually increase the deficit effect of tax cut .  Past tax cut in 1981 and the early 2000s have lead to widen budget deficit and low revenue , not the reverse a some claim .  Instead of rely on magic bullet and fairy dust to pay for tax cut , policymakers should ensure rate reduction do not add to the debt .  Instead , they should focus on pursue comprehensive tax reform a have be propose by numerous commission , committee , and tax expert from across the political spectrum .  By repeal tax preference , broaden the tax base , and reduce rate , tax reform have the potential to reduce distortion , improve simplicity and fairness , and grow the economy more .  At Current Rates , Tax Cuts Can ’ t Produce Enough Growth to be Self-Financing While well-designed tax cut can promote economic growth that lead to “ feedback ” revenue , it be not realistic for this additional revenue to be close to a large a the initial tax cut .  Since the federal government collect only a fraction of fund from any additional economic activity , the added economic growth would need to be many time large than the initial revenue loss .  No Reasonable Economic Model Shows Tax Cuts Paying for Themselves Theory aside , there be no evidence that large tax cut could pay for themselves .  especially argue that the 1981 and 2001/2003 tax cut pay for themselves .  They summarize that most study find either only a very small positive effect or a negative effect on growth due to the deficit-financed nature of the tax cut .  Looking at revenue a a share of potential GDP , which use cyclical adjustment to account for recession , one can see very clearly the effect of these tax cut on revenue .  With regard both the 1981 and 2001/2003 tax cut , CBO find that actual revenue collection be much low than what have be project prior to the tax cut passing .  Indeed , the 1981 tax cut be such a drain on revenue that lawmaker from both party come together to reverse about one-third of them in 1982 .  This revenue loss be also double the amount that CBO expect from the tax cut alone due to economic and technical revision .  Like the 1980s , CBO do not anticipate the 2001 recession , but the estimate clearly show that the tax cut didn ’ t cause an increase in revenue and be a particularly big factor in lower-than-expected revenue once the economy recover .  This be why nearly all economic model find that tax cut will at best pay for a fraction of their cost through fast economic growth and at bad may slow growth and further reduce revenue .  Actual experience with tax cut in recent decade verifies this , a both the 1981 and early 2000s tax cut lead to a significant reduction in revenue .

The fiscal cliff refers to a combination of expire tax cut and across-the-board government spending cut that create a looming imbalance in the federal budget and must be correct to avert a crisis .  The idea behind the fiscal cliff be that if the federal government allow these two event to proceed a plan , they would have a detrimental effect on an already shaky economy , perhaps send it back into an official recession a it cut household income , increased unemployment rate , and undermined consumer and investor confidence .  At the same time , it be predict that go over the fiscal cliff would significantly reduce the federal budget deficit .  `` Falling off `` the fiscal cliff have be avert through new legislation that correct for the shortfall or that authorize great level of government debt , such a through the American Taxpayer Relief Act Of 2012 .  monetary policy , fiscal cliff can emerge from time to time , but have never yet cause a serious financial crisis .

***** Reflections on the Congressional Budget Act Learning from Previous Budget Reform Efforts In reform the congressional budget process , Congress should strengthen nonpartisan institution such a the CBO , put tax and spending on a level playing field , and eliminate brinkmanship over the debt ceiling .  The far-reaching tax change be rush through Congress in a matter of week under the special fast-track budget reconciliation process , strain procedure that have be design to ensure deliberative and inclusive consideration of fiscal policy .  The majority in Congress choose to disregard the budget impact estimate of the Joint Committee on Taxation ( JCT ) and the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , while the Treasury Department produce no public revenue or distributional analysis of the bill .  Congress hold no hearing on the legislation where it could have hear from tax expert , affect community , or the general public ; it conduct key negotiation behind closed door ; and it make numerous , consequential change at the last minute before critical vote , without provide sufficient time for the public or even most member to understand the effect of those change .  2 It be essential to restore rationality and basic norm to the budget process in order to ensure that this approach do not set a new and dangerous precedent for the nation .  The result of the 1974 CBA have be mix , however , in term of both it state goal and the budget process that evolve .  While the budget process at first work largely a intend , adherence in Congress to the CBA ’ s process and deadline have erode , and today , the budget process have be warp by brinkmanship and partisan posturing , a member of Congress increasingly use budget chokepoint to try to extract policy concession from the other side .  This report examine the major reform enact a part of the CBA and assess what be work and where the current budget process have go astray .  3 The report recommend several reform , include that Congress should increase transparency and access to information by strengthen nonpartisan institution such a the CBO and create neutrality between tax and budget process .  It also recommend that Congress take step to address the brinkmanship and partisan posturing in the current budget process by eliminate the debt ceiling and streamline the budget resolution process .  Bush and a Republican-controlled Senate seek to enact deficit-increasing tax cut , the Senate parliamentarian—the official appoint by the Senate to serve a it expert on rule and procedure , whose ruling be follow except in rare instances—informally rule to allow reconciliation bill that increase deficit within the budget window .  And due to the structure of tax rate , which increase a income increase , tax expenditure that be structure a exclusion or deduction typically have regressive impact , provide large benefit to higher-income taxpayer than to those with low income .
***** I first want to start off by say how tough a job we know that the Congressional Budget Office and it employee have .  We appreciate the professionalism , the expertise that you have bring to the job .  Everybody bring to this job a background and a perspective and a point of view .  We will have probably difference of opinion on methodology and thing like that from time to time .  And I also just want to simply start by say I think it be great that you do more consulting with outside academic and outside forecaster because we do n't have all the wisdom here , and it be important that you do that consultation .  And these problem that we have , let me first start off by say it be not all the Democratic Party 's fault or the Republican Party 's fault .  I would argue that in the most recent history I think our fiscal policy go in the wrong direction .  And what be interest about this and previous report that you have be give u be , we know that without a shadow of doubt , we be give the next generation a low standard of living .  What amaze me be when you do your long-run modelling , that your model actually end up shut down by the time our kid be in our age bracket because the CBO ca n't conceive a point in which the economy can continue because of the debt burden that be be place upon it .

There never really was a Hastert Rule.
***** October 23 , 2015 The so-called Hastert rule be simply common sense .  But Nancy Pelosi have so entrench Democratic uniformity that rule be less relevant .
***** 1214 Because of a wrestling injury , Hastert never serve in the military .  `` 4849 Nevertheless , in November 2004 , Hastert institute what become know a the Hastert Rule ( or `` majority of the majority `` rule ) , which be an informal , self-imposed political practice of allow the House to vote on only those bill that be support by the majority of it Republican member .  53 In 2013 , after leave office , Hastert disown the policy , say that `` there be no Hastert Rule `` and that the `` rule `` be more of a principle that the majority party should follow it own policy .  54 Congressional expert Norm Ornstein write that Hastert `` blow up `` the House 's `` regular order , `` which be `` a mix of rule and norm that allow debate , deliberation , and amendment in committee and on the House floor , that incorporate and do not shut out the minority ( even if it still lose most of the time ) , that take bill that pass both house to a conference committee to reconcile difference , [ and ] that allow time for member and staff to read , digest , and analyze bill .
***** “ That ’ s what the Hastert rule be really about , Feehery , now a lobbyist and consultant , tell me recently — political survival .  According to John Feehery , the staffer who coin the phrase , former Speaker Dennis Hastert be often credit with invent the rule but Newt Gingrich , who precede him a Speaker , follow it as well .
***** “ In the Senate , Senator Reid , use the rule of the Senate , be able to stop some of this destructive legislation , as well .  Well first of all there never be a ‘ Hastert Rule .  The approach that they would take would never have allow this important budget bill to come to the floor .  If that be the rule , the full faith and credit of the United States would be dishonor .  So I hope that this Speaker will not be constrain by that so-called rule , which a I say , be never a rule .

Hastert himself say that there 's `` confusion `` about the rule name after him .
***** Speaker Denny Hastert coin his eponymous rule in 2003 when he declare that the “ job of the Speaker be not to expedite legislation that run counter to the wish of the majority of the majority .  In the parlance of many legislative scholar , the majority party be “ roll , ” a strict no-no for a leadership say to be guide by Hastert ’ s rule .  It ’ s too early to know whether Speaker Boehner will continue to violate the Hastert rule .

***** Republicans , think they ’ d never win a majority , have often choose to go along with part of the progressive agenda—so long a the Democrats incorporate some conservative idea a well .  But rather than pursue a purely policy-oriented strategy , they push to change the rule that govern the way Washington work .  the Speaker , who control which bill be debate on the House floor , would never bring a bill up for consideration unless a majority of the majority party support it .
***** It be cite a the main reason why House Speaker John Boehner win ’ t allow a vote to fund the government with no Obamacare string attached—under the rule , no legislation can be bring to the floor without a majority of Republican vote .  But the rule ’ s namesake , former House speaker Denny Hastert , tell The Daily Beast on Wednesday , “ The Hastert Rule never really exist .

In this research , we use a visual analytic approach to explore the association between education and health over a 20-year period for country around the world .  MethodUsing empirical data from the OECD and the World Bank for 26 OECD country for the year 1995 .  2015 , we identify patterns/associations between education and health indicator .  By incorporate pre- and post-educational attainment indicator , we highlight the dual role of education a both a driver of opportunity as well a of inequality .  ResultsAdults with high educational attainment have good health and lifespan compare to their less-educated peer .

***** States have many tool in their arsenal to increase productivity , include investment in public infrastructure , in technological innovation at public university and other institution , and in worker through the education and train system .  In these state , the focus be on lure employer from other state with strategy that do not lead to rise income because they do not make the workforce more productive .  There be a clear and strong correlation between the educational attainment of a state ’ s workforce and median wage in the state .  States can build a strong foundation for economic success and share prosperity by invest in education .  Providing expand access to high quality education will not only expand economic opportunity for resident , but also likely do more to strengthen the overall state economy than anything else a state government can do .  Cutting tax to capture private investment from other state be a race-to-the-bottom state economic development strategy that undermine the ability to invest in education .

***** In the Power Profile series , speaker discuss the leadership style , psychology , personality , and policy of well-known leader from around the world .

And there have be a tug—there be a tug-of-war between a number of different individual , some counseling , you know , that he make concession , some that he crack down , and that ultimately the security chief convince Assad that they could put down the uprising in a couple of week , and then they could just go back to normal .  And so he give that speech—which , you know , reflect the fact that he ’ s someone that a lot of people have hope for when he come into power a a reformer .  So , in a way , each draft of that speech represent a different profile of who Assad be .  And then , when it completely end up be the reverse , I realize that we be go down a very , very different road .  Well , let ’ s just—let me just interrupt and say I ’ m sure most people know , but Assad and his family be member of the Alawite minority community .  The Alawites , when they come to Damascus in big number after Hafez al-Assad take power in the ’ 70 , be call muwafeddin ( ph ) , concurrent commonly in Damascus .  And so , when—if Assad have be tempt to go down the road of reform , the people around him say , you ’ re a fool , you ’ re naïve , you don ’ t understand the region .
***** It 's still unclear how the wind will blow when it come to Syria , in term of whether the protest will continue to grow in strength and the repression become bloodier but also whether the US will eventually call for Bashar al-Assad 's departure or issue endless call for dialogue while try to push for internal reform .

This loophole enable people with felony conviction , domestic abuse restrain order , and other people with prohibit history to buy gun with no question ask .  The loophole should be close to require background check on all gun sales—not just on the sale of firearm from license gun dealer .  Current federal law do not require background check on sale between unlicensed party .  This mean that people with dangerous history can easily circumvent the background check system simply by purchase their firearm online or at a gun show .

Such transaction be more anonymous than purchase a weapon at a gun show , where people who cant pass a background check can buy large quantity of gun .  By 2011 , it be one of the large online gun site in the country , with more than 13,000 active listing for firearm .  An undercover New York City investigation ( PDF ) find that the site likely be a major conduit for illegal gun sale .  Investigators discover that 54 percent of the seller they contact through the site be openly willing to sell firearm to people who admit they couldnt pass a background check ( which be a felony , incidentally ) .  When New York City take a look at the online gun marketplace in 2011 , it find more than 25,000 weapon for sale on just 10 website , make the internet a significant component of gun industry .  The real number arent know because the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives do not track how many gun be sell online or how many of them be use in crime .  Jon Lowy , director of the legal action project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence , say , The last figure we have be 40 percent of gun sale take place without a background check .  Today the internet provide a mechanism to facilitate countless private sale without a background check , no question ask .  ATF investigate the gun sale , but no one be charge because private sale be only illegal if the seller know the buyer cant pas a background check .  Just a gun show have be a problem because criminal know they can buy gun without detection , the internet be a place where criminal , felon , and other prohibit purchaser can find a weapon , he note .
***** 13 , 2019Federal law bar Jody Lee Hunt from ever own a gun .  In a note he write before turn the gun on himself , he say he want his victim to get “ their fair pay of hurt .  They be suppose to be block by a federal instant background check database that license firearm dealer be require to query before hand weapon over to a buyer .  But federal gun law contain a major loophole .  Transactions between private seller and buyer do not require a background check .  That use to typically just mean sale at gun show , or through listing find in classified ad .  But that be before the internet make it a easy a a few mouse click to find a gun for sale from a private seller on an online marketplace or through social medium .
***** All Tech Considered The Armslist website , and others like it , be come under increase scrutiny by law enforcement , gun control advocate and researcher a debate over access to these kind of weapon heat up .  But there 's no way to know whether buyer and seller who meet through Armslist be follow federal , state or local background check rule .  We want to see how many semi-automatic firearm — define here a handgun and rifle able to rapidly fire a large number of bullet , one shot per trigger pull , without have to reload — can be currently find on Armslist , and how quickly new list appear .  So do the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter , the San Bernardino killer , and at least 70 percent of shooter list in a database of all mass shoot in America since 1982 compile by Mother Jones .  Our data analysis show that semiautomatic weapon comprise at least 1 in 4 firearm list on Armslist in the day follow the Orlando shooting .  Those shooter acquire their firearm in a variety of way , and there 's no evidence that any of them use Armslist .  But this site , and others like it , be come under increase scrutiny by law enforcement , gun control advocate , and researcher a debate over access to these kind of weapon heat up .  There 's no federal law require a private gun owner to run a background check before sell someone a gun .
Weve seen 115,000 jobs created in the American auto industry since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy.
***** Because Treasury have cite different , conflict goal for it automotive intervention at different times—saying , for example , that it wish to save American job , to produce the best possible return to taxpayer , or to return the company to private ownership a rapidly a possible—it be difficult for the Panel or any outside observer to judge whether Treasury ’ s result in fact qualify a successful .  The remain 90 percent of Chrysler be parcel out to several other party , include the Italian automotive manufacturer Fiat , through the bankruptcy process—but while this approach may have save Chrysler from liquidation , the result be that Treasury have little authority to act in taxpayer ’ interest .  Treasury ’ s rescue suggest that any sufficiently large American corporation—even if it be not a bank—may be consider ‘ ‘ too big to fail , ’ ’ create a risk that moral hazard will infect area of the economy far beyond the financial system .  These intervention be accomplish use resource from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , a program that Congress create with passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act ( EESA ) in October 2008 and which be aim primarily at prevent economic collapse by restore stability in the financial sector .  The intervening time since the Panel ’ s last report on the GM and Chrysler rescue have also allow for some great understanding of how Treasury would behave a an investor in both firm .  That report note that there be linger unresolved issue relate to GMAC/Ally Financial ’ s emerge business strategy .  In the 10 month since that report be issue , the firm ’ s operate performance have improve considerably , but Treasury ’ s exit strategy remain unclear .  Hence , the Bush Administration choose a middle-of-the-road option , provide the firm with TARP-financed loan sufficient to tide them over for a few month but leave it to a new administration to make it own assessment a to the long-term viability of GM and Chrysler and ultimately to choose to put the firm through expedite bankruptcy proceeding .  These favorable event , however , must be thoughtfully balance against the moral hazard risk create by the taxpayer ’ s bailout of the three institution and the ongoing implicit guarantee of the government .  Unless they could raise billion of dollar in new financing from private investor , they face bankruptcy and probable liquidation .  114 Since 2008 , the company have reduce it global workforce by about 35,000 employee , include about 11,000 hourly employee in United States,115 though the number of employee have rise since GM emerge from bankruptcy in 2009 .  363 Although a substantial loss in GM business would have a meaningful impact on GMAC/ Ally Financial ’ s ongoing viability because the company ’ s auto finance platform have not yet undergone sufficient diversification , it be likely that an unwinding of GM ’ s relationship with GMAC/Ally Financial would happen over the long term , which would allow for the impact of the loss to be spread over a period of time .
***** Mitt Romney 's company , Bain Capital , invest in a series of firm that specialize in outsource American job to other country , accord to a new report from The Washington Post .  ADVERTISEMENTThe Democratic National Committee blast Romney on the report , call him a `` pioneer `` in outsource job overseas .
***** A more holistic understanding of the industry be important since it footprint account for an estimated one in every 22 U .  A number of theme emerge .  These independent entity , fund to take on responsibility for retiree health care , help to dramatically reduce automaker ’ liability for health benefit , and provide retiree with much great assurance of continuity of benefit than if they have rely on company that might declare bankruptcy .  Instead , all 50,000 worker who lose their job do so through voluntary separation package .  As the domestic industry prepares for 2015 collective bargaining , a full appreciation of the complexity of the industry ’ s technical and social dynamic be necessary in order to contextualize issue such a domestic job creation , the entry wage , and new technology .  ( Cutcher-Gershenfeld , Brooks , and Mulloy 2015 , 147 ) Back on the job , she describe the impact of the training .  This be not a false empowerment but truly and genuinely acknowledge that we have each choose our part of the job and both be part of success .  The congressional representative ’ question reveal just how little they know about this industry and the role of labor and management in work to transform quality , safety , and other operational aspect .
***** These action save more than one million American job , accord to independent estimate .  The automobile industry be now profitable and create job at the fast pace in 15 year .  In fact , since June 2009 , when GM and Chrysler emerge from bankruptcy , more than 500,000 job have be create .
***** The report discuss the job create in the sector , the turnaround of the company that be now turn a profit , and how entire community have be revitalize by a strengthened auto industry .  Two year ago , on June 1 , 2009 , General Motors file for bankruptcy , back by $ 30 billion in support from the federal government .  The same day , in the same New York courthouse , a judge approve Chryslers plan to forge an alliance with Fiat and emerge from bankruptcy a a restructured business with an uncertain future .  The report discuss the job create in the sector , the turnaround of the company that be now turn a profit , and how entire community have be revitalize by a strengthened auto industry .
***** In 2009 , GM and Chrysler be on the verge of bankruptcy and be rumor to possibly go out of business .  The White House note that , in the year before GM and Chrysler file for bankruptcy , the auto industry shed over 400,000 job .  Had President Obama fail to intervene , conservative estimate suggest that it would have cost at least an additional one million job and devastate the already teeter economy .
***** Some $ 426 billion in taxpayer money would soon be lent or directly invest in major bank and corporation to try to stabilize the financial system and prevent even more job loss .  The government authorize emergency loan so the company could continue pay bill and make payroll , then go through a structured bankruptcy process and quickly return to production .  Chrysler emerge a a newly merge company with Italian-based Fiat .  To run the auto bailout part of TARP , the new Obama administration create the White House Council on Automotive Communities and Workers .  We be lose million of job , ” Mark Zandi , Moody ’ s chief economist , say of the Great Recession .
***** If all of the Detroit Three fail each of the other two industry segment would be severely damage and most would likely fail ; although the non U .  A short period of time , perhaps only two or three month , without GM order would probably force a liquidation of Delphi which , in turn , would probably force a bankruptcy of GM from which it may well never emerge .  CAR have calculate that the total loss of job due to the multiplier effect of the failure of the U .  This level of unemployment have not be experience since the Great Depression .  since 1948 have be 10 .  It seem likely that if these rate be realize the multiplier effect thereof , while incalculable , will create even high unemployment rate than suggest here and a profound recession the like of which have not be experience in the U .
***** The great industry support roughly 10 million American job .  No other industry in America have such an expansive reach to every state , deliver economic benefit and create job in so many different sector .
***** Even though all Americans , I would hope , want this industry to succeed , and the worker who work at those factory , I can not support a plan to spend taxpayer money to bail them out .  A bailout of the auto industry would just push the problem far down the path .  There be uncertainty in the market , and job loss be mount .  It be our responsibility a lawmaker to act decisively to reverse this economic downturn and save million of American job .  It be a vote to protect the American people , protect their job , their economic well-being .  auto industry to die and lose million of job support by this vital industry fulfill his definition of protect American job or small business ? .  Denying support to the auto industry , lose million of job across the country , run counter to the initial intent of Congress in pa a rescue package .  The auto industry be American job .  auto industry create the middle class and the manufacturing sector , the backbone of our very economy .  Now imagine the economic impact of multiply those job loss by 50 ; that be the magnitude of what be at stake today .  If we lose one of the Big Three , we will lose literally perhaps a many a 2\1/2\ million job almost overnight , and the ripple effect will be devastate on the national scale .
Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power.
***** McCain talk up oil drilling , green energy Republican presidential candidate say we need to drill new well now , while support innovative transportation technology and `` the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .  -- John McCain formally accept the Republican Party 's presidential nomination here on Thursday in a speech extol the virtue of both oil drilling and green energy .  We will produce more energy at home .  Obama think we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .
***** These rise gas price be a direct result of President Bidens energy agenda .  He also rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement , which will kill energy job while do little to protect the environment .  Democrats in Congress have plan to escalate this assault on American energy .  Their massive tax-and-spending proposal would include Green New Deal style tax hike and other restriction on traditional energy source , which would likely result in high energy cost for American household .
***** Among the provision in his energy plan be program to support alternative fuel development , inclusion of offshore oil drilling in a potential compromise energy policy , and personal conservation effort .  Senator Barack Obama talk about the economy and outline several energy initiative at a campaign event .
***** President Obama 's decision to increase drilling for oil , off the coast of Virginia and perhaps elsewhere , be think to have be make to win over GOP vote for his climate legislation languish in Congress .  How will they react to today 's Obama move on drilling ? .  While Republicans argue that increase drilling for oil in the U .  Drilling will not reduce fuel price , and will not make u more energy independent .  The only way to achieve these goal be to reduce our dependence on oil -- foreign or domestic -- through fuel economy , and a cap on carbon emission .  A carbon cap will spur innovation and shift u into a green energy economy .  The New York Times ' John Broder write that today 's proposal by Obama could `` help win political support for comprehensive energy and climate legislation , `` but at the same time , `` the sheer breadth of the offshore drilling decision will take some of his supporter aback .
***** There be broad agreement on the urgent need for a range of policy and new technology solution to tackle the nation ’ s energy problem , though the candidate ’ s platform differ in the detail .  Kammen , a professor at UC Berkeley , be also a member of the APS study group that issue a report on energy efficiency in September ( see the October APS News ) .  Both candidate recognize the need to implement a variety of measure to solve the energy problem .  Both side of the aisle , Republicans and Democrats , have awake to the need to do something about an energy system that be fundamentally out of date , ” Kammen say .  Obama ’ s energy plan include develop new renewable energy source , increase research and development , and a cap and trade system for carbon dioxide emission .  Kammen call McCain ’ s vision of 45 new nuclear plant unrealistic , though Obama support nuclear power if it can be do safely .  Recognizing the need for energy independence , Obama would support some offshore drilling for oil if it be part of a broad compromise that bring about investment in clean energy alternative , Kammen say , but he would not force offshore drill on state that do not want it .
***** The ad highlight Barack Obama 's opposition to initiative that will help to lower gas price and achieve energy independence .  Barack Obama oppose more drilling in America , expand nuclear energy use and incentive to spark electric-car research .  Unlike Barack Obama , John McCain have propose a comprehensive , balance plan to achieve energy independence -- the Lexington Project -- that support more drilling , expand the use of nuclear energy , encourage more research while invest in alternative energy source .  Gas price - $ 4 , $ 5 , no end in sight , because some in Washington be still say no to drilling in America .  Do n't hope for more energy , vote for it .  Gas price - $ 4 , $ 5 , no end in sight , because some in Washington be still say no to drilling in America .  Obama deride this a a gimmick , but McCain 's idea for develop a radically good battery for power a new generation of car strike u a smart than more bureaucratic approach .
***** Bernie Sanders on Energy Policy The United States , under a Sanders presidency , will lead the world in transform our energy system away from fossil fuel , create million of job , and create a less polluting society .  Bernie Sanders , 2019 Bernie be commit to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel by enact climate-neutral energy policy .  He believe we should keep fossil fuel in the ground and instead use renewable energy and sustainable energy while improve energy efficiency .  The worker most affect by the transition to clean energy will see large investment in job retraining , job creation , and environmental clean up effort in their community .  must transform it energy system away from fossil fuel such a oil , gas , and coal and move aggressively towards energy-efficient , sustainable , clean , and renewable energy solution such a wind , solar , and geothermal .  We must stop building new nuclear power plant , and find a real solution to our exist nuclear waste problem .  We should ban offshore drilling and ban all future lease and current leasing of federally own land for extract coal , natural gas , oil , and tar sand and end U .  Working family must be able to afford access to energy from sustainable source and receive help in implement sustainable energy practice at home .  Transformation to a sustainable energy system base on energy efficiency and renewable energy source will create thousand of job .
***** McCain attack Obama over opposition to nuclear power and oil drilling .
***** Weve witness a terrible earthquake , a catastrophic tsunami , a nuclear emergency that have batter one of our strong ally and close friend in the world third-largest economy .  And it natural , I think , to feel anxious about what all of this mean for u .  And one big area of concern have be the cost and security of our energy .  Obviously , the situation in the Middle East implicate our energy security .  The situation in Japan lead u to ask question about our energy source .  And thats because youve get country like India and China that be grow at a rapid clip , and a 2 billion more people start consume more good -- they want car just like weve get car ; they want to use energy to make their life a little easy just like weve got -- it be absolutely certain that demand will go up a lot faster than supply .  And we will keep on be a victim to shift in the oil market until we finally get serious about a long-term policy for a secure , affordable energy future .  Were go to have to think long term , which be why I come here , to talk to young people here at Georgetown , because you have more of a stake in u get our energy policy right than just about anybody .  Politicians of every stripe have promise energy independence , but that promise have so far go unmet .

***** Paul to be president of the United States he promise to embark on the most ambitious national project in decade , bring energy production home .  My friend , well build more nuclear power plant .  And McCain say if Americans want to stop send $ 700 billion every year for energy to unfriendly nation and protect the planet , they should vote Republican .  Senator Obama think we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .  But wasnt Senator McCain oppose to offshore drilling not so long ago ? .
***** Every day , when there be no camera around to draw attention to it , this company and others like it be engage in the great enterprise of energy independence .  Solar power be one of many alternative energy source that be change our economy for the good .  All who work in pursuit of new and clean energy source understand that America 's energy problem do not go away when oil and gasoline price fall , a they have in recent week .  This be hardly a good sign of thing to come , and should only add to our sense of urgency in gain energy independence .  In Washington , we can view this period of low oil price a just one more chance to make excuse -- and on the problem of energy security , we 've hear enough excuse .  In reality , volatile oil price be just the most immediate consequence when foreign power control our energy supply .  And price will stabilize only when we have reach the great goal of energy security for America .

***** But the key to balance the budget -- and we talk about all the waste in government and the inefficiency .  I 'd love to do that to the federal government .  That 's essential to rein in the scale of the federal government .  And that 's why I lay out a plan to restructure the foundation of America 's economy to start create job again so people be pay tax , business be pay tax , not because we 're raise the rate , but because we 're grow the economy .  The right answer for America be to stop the growth of the federal government and to start the growth of the private sector .

But the real issue be in write his book , Governor Perry point out that in his view that Social Security be unconstitutional , that this be not something the federal government ought to be involve in , that instead it should be give back to the state .  If what you 're try to say be that back in the '30s and the '40s that the federal government make all the right decision , I disagree with you .  And anybody who know anything about the federal government know that there 's such an enormous volume of waste , that if you simply have a serious all-all effort to modernize the federal government , you would have hundred of billion of dollar of save fall off .  But let me start with -- all of you should go to Strong America Now , which be a group that believe if you modernize the federal government , you save $ 500 billion a year .  Now , check and see whether the super committee of 12 in their august power be willing to sit down with that group and actually learn how to be smart rather than cheap , and actually modernize the federal government .

***** Speaker , I want to pick up a little bit where I leave off yesterday , a I start my response to the NDP 's ninth deficit budget in a row , by comment on some of the area where we see difficulty in this budget , and there be many .  It 's an interesting way that the government have account for it in this year 's budget .  The government talk in it budget about new spending for health care -- new spending this year over last year , new spending over what they spend last year .  This year the government say it 's go to draw down $ 454 million of the money that be set aside by the federal government and give to the provincial government for health care .  But if you look at the budget document and the budget report , you 'll find that the revise forecast for health care spending last year be $ 8 .  5025 billion , which leave a difference of $ 341 .  I 'd be anxious to hear what the Minister of Finance have to say about his plan for health care spending in the coming year .  [ 1015 ] [ Page 14548 ] I remember the former Minister of Finance , the member for Vancouver-Hastings , who be now the Deputy Premier , say a little over a year ago that .  One of the other area that the government have be trumpet in this budget be it tax cut .  They be so tiny in proportion to what the government have be do over the last number of year that it 's virtually impossible to find them .  1 billion in new revenue this next fiscal year .  If the government do n't cut anything , if it do n't cut one penny out of any program -- in fact , if it add maybe half a billion dollar to program spending -- they 'd still have $ 600 million to play with for a tax cut .

Although President Barack Obama have continue to use presidential signing statement , the Obama Administration have use the interpretive tool with less frequency than previous administrations—issuing 20 signing statement , of which 10 ( 50 % ) contain constitutional challenge to an enacted statutory provision .  Article I of the Constitution provide only that the President `` shall sign `` a bill of which he approve , while in veto a measure the President be require to return the measure `` with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originate .  Chadha , which strike down a unconstitutional the congressional practice of subject various executive branch action to a legislative veto , the Court note that `` 11 Presidents , from Mr .  Reagan , who have be present with this issue have go on record at some point to challenge congressional veto a unconstitutional .  32 The memorandum go on to advise that in decide whether to refuse to enforce a provision of law , the President should weigh `` the effect of compliance with the provision on the constitutional right of affected individual and on the executive branch 's constitutional authority , `` with a focus on the likelihood of whether that compliance or non-compliance would permit judicial resolution of the issue .  46 The Bush II Administration be particularly prolific in issue signing statement that object to provision that it claim infringe on the President 's power over foreign affair ( oftentimes with regard to requirement that the Administration take a particular position in negotiation with foreign power ) ; provision that require the submission of proposal or recommendation to Congress47 ( assert that they interfere with the President 's authority under the Recommendations Clause to `` recommend such Measures a he shall judge necessary and expedient `` ) ; provision that imposed disclosure or reporting requirement ( on the ground that such provision may interfere with the President 's authority to withhold sensitive or privileged information ) ; condition and qualification on executive appointment ( assert infringement on the President 's authority pursuant to the Appointments Clause ) ; and legislative veto provision ( on the ground that they violate bicameralism and presentment requirement a establish in INS v .

***** We will start with Doug Holtz-Eakin say a few word about fiscal policy and go to Bill Hoagland , who will talk about non-defense discretionary [ spending ] .  We 've get risk on the upside in non-defense discretionary spending , and we 've get the AMT linger out there a something that everyone would like to get off the book , but with no new revenue-neutral replacement in sight .  On the non-defense side , the question be , what will the policy be that can hold spending this tight ? .  And that would be entirely desirable because , past the next couple of year , the fundamental fiscal policy dilemma be the fact that Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid just ramp up and go so far north that no one can imagine it .  And the dividing line be a world in which real defense spending go down by 25 percent , not up , non-discretionary defense—or discretionary non-defense spending be freeze in real term , and health care cost only rise at the same rate a the economy instead of 2 .  So those be the key issue that be all go to be touch on by people around this table , and I 'm go to beat the meat timer and quit right there .  Why do n't we go right to Bill , and then have a little discussion , then go on to some of the other topic ? .  Bob ask me to talk about non-defense discretionary spending .  You combine that with this first chart , this color chart that I distribute , that show that a broad definition of this category of spending have grow rapidly in the last five year , six year , up 8 percent by that chart , a rate not see since the late '70s .  And I do n't think it 's any surprise then , for the average citizen out there , that they conclude that it 's in this area of the government that spending be out of control .
***** 4 Embracing high environmental standard out of principle be one thing , however , accept subsequent far-reaching and significant lifestyle change in the form of high gas price or reduced mobility , for instance , be quite another , a fact acknowledge by both climate change denier and the Obama administration .  They issue one mislead ‘ report ’ after another , pretend that there be a significant disagreement in the legitimate scientific community in area where there be actually a broad-based consensus .  They argue , in a counter-intuitive way , that the best way to protect the environment be by maximize economic freedom and eliminating government .  For instance , strong private property law be often the best way to encourage people to act in environmentally friendly way .
***** In his State of the Union address , the President ask Congress to give him line-item veto .  Today , the President be transmit to Congress legislation that would give him a constitutional line-item veto .  one , to give the President a scalpel to reduce unnecessary or wasteful spending ; and , second , to improve accountability and cast a brighter light on the practice of slip earmark into bill at the last minute .  Most of you be aware that the Congress do enact a line-item veto which be available to the President in 1996 , but the Supreme Court strike that law down a unconstitutional a draft .  Since 1996 , when the law be strike down , earmark have increase dramatically , and that 's part of the reason why the President have decide to send forward specific legislation now to restore a line-item veto authority and , in particular , restore one that pass constitutional muster .  It provide the President the authority to single out wasteful discretionary or mandatory spending , or special interest tax break give to a small number of individual and to put them on hold .  During the time that the spending line-item be on hold , the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the line-item .  This authority would allow the President to hold up to the full light of public scrutiny wasteful spending that might have be pass a part of large legislation .  As you all be undoubtedly aware , spending legislation usually come to the President in the form of very large bill , many of them with ten of billion of dollar of spending in them .  In fact , I do n't think serious constitutional question could be raise about it , because instead of give the President the authority unilaterally to line out some spending , what the President do be he take the spending that he want to take out of a bill , put it into a separate piece of legislation , send that forward to the Congress ; the Congress then have -- that legislation then be entitle to expedite procedure in the Congress , and be entitle to an up or down vote in both house within 10 day .  So the Congress , under the procedure that the President have propose , be propose today , still need to act , actually need to adopt legislation that would rescind the previously enact spending .  And if there be a majority in both Houses to take out the spending , a I think we 're hopeful there would be , then that become a statute on it own , and the President would sign the statute and the spending would be rescind .  He 's talk a lot about the need to curb federal spending , but I have n't hear him talk much about a line-item veto .  With respect to the specific of an individual spending item with which the President might disagree , even though it 's within an overall spending cap , I think this procedure that we 're send forward today would cure the difficulty that arise in try to get that out of the spending once the bill -- once the overall bill be adopt .  Because if I recall correctly , in the last two budget at least , the line-item veto language only talk about spending , if I recall correctly .  The Congress have live within the limit that he have set on appropriation bill -- a I say , not always with exactly the mix of spending that the President have request , often with item that the President would not have include in a bill that the administration be write on it own .  Q Back to this issue of report language , I 'm just sort of curious why there be n't -- why the President do n't consider really go after some of these earmark , particularly one that have be consider to be egregious by group and put out a list of -- here be a list of earmark that my agency have find particularly to be wasteful and I 'm not go to do them -- and sort of pick a fight with Congress and force them to put it in legislative language ? .
***** 2 ) to give the President item veto authority over appropriation Acts and target tax benefit in revenue Acts .  The line-item veto propose in H .  2 be a real line-item veto , with the type of teeth many of u know be necessary to bring about great fiscal discipline .  { time } 1030 It be fit that we consider the line-item veto under a wide open rule and this be a wide open rule .  This be a serious discussion about rein in Federal spending , restore accountability to the congressional budget process and balance the power of the executive and legislative branch of Government .  I be proud to offer my colleague this wide open rule , one that allow any Member to be hear on issue of concern .  At this point I understand we have 31 amendment out there which have be file under the option of prefiling , and no doubt we will be hear other amendment under the 5-minute rule because we do have one very important issue on policy and a whole lot of other issue on precedent .  The spirit of bipartisanship we have see on this legislation -- even a some clearly do disagree on how far a line-item veto should go -- have be particularly refreshing and give me great hope .  2 to give the President the option to propose that save from his line-item veto be apply toward deficit reduction .  While this language may technically have be nongermane to the bill a write , I would think most Americans -- and certainly most Members I hope -- see the goal of cut the deficit a highly germane to the subject of line item veto .  If we be go to take this step to give the President the authority to cut or reduce spending -- or target tax benefit -- we should also provide the option that the money be save rather than spend elsewhere .  it be likely that he will or she will use the rescission process -- the new line-item veto authority -- a a threat to secure appropriation for program that the President want enact , rather than to reduce total spending .
***** We 'll assess how the next president will handle those issue with two top U .  We 'll also talk with two governor on the short list for vice president , Republican Mark Sanford and Democrat Janet Napolitano .  What be the best way of get to the same goal , if you like , and I think we be very clear now what we want to do .  I certainly agree with the prime minister and I think it 's the right time now to start talk about plan a timeline horizon .  We 'll speak with a man think to be on Senator McCain 's short list for vice president , Republican Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina .  So , until Barack Obama and John McCain actually announce who will be on the other half of the ticket , `` Late Edition `` will be take a close look at the contender on the so-called short list for vice president .  The decision will ultimately be make by the next president of the United States .  Regrettably , the president have not be exactly busy with the veto pen on earmark .

***** That roadmap offer a balanced approach to fix our long-term fiscal problem , with about a third of the save come from new revenue and about two-thirds come from spend reduction that would touch domestic spending , defense spending , and entitlement .  Sometimes when Congress pass appropriation bill , a spending item or two , maybe three , may be include that do not make much sense .  Far too often , we accept a handful of spending item that be truly wasteful a the cost of do business in just get bill pa .  A common sense way to prevent this from occur be to modify the President 's ability to get Congress to consider spending cut .  Any time we send the President a spending bill under current law now , he or she can sign it and then propose that the Congress consider rescind or either reduce or eliminate certain item , spend item , in that bill .  It permanently enable the President to veto any spending or revenue measure within legislation unless both chamber vote , by a super-majority , to override the President 's action .  It do not say the President -- it just say the President could veto spend item , line item in spending bill , in appropriation bill , so the President could go into entitlement legislation and veto , line item veto , item there ; and also , do the same thing with revenue measure .  And that those veto , those line item veto within discretionary spending , entitlement program , and in revenue would become law unless two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate vote to override those cut .  I talk to one of my colleague today , Senator McCain , who be here in 1996 , and I be try to convince him to sign a a co-sponsor of our legislation , and I compare our legislation to a 4-year test drive , which really be a statutory line in the veto power to the President , and I say , `` Compare this to what be available in 1996 .  Our bill would provide this authority only through 2015 , create something akin to what I call a 4-year test drive , a 4-year test drive for statutory line item veto power .  Our proposal would simply update an exist budget process to give the President a target , effective tool that he or she can use to single out individual line item in appropriation bill .  Congress would still have a strong voice in the process and we would have to approve the President 's proposed rescission , but the expedited rescission authority would help root out some questionable spending that make it more difficult to reach our deficit reduction goal .  This modify rescission process both provide the White House with responsibility in ensure that wasteful measure be not include in new spending bill , but it also retain the final decisionmaking power with Congress in a balanced and bicameral way .

***** Ironically , give Presidents more power to control spending do just the opposite .  The struggle over government spending have be a fundamental point of contention since the early day of our Federal Government .

***** On the subject of government spending he once very accurately observe that , `` Nothing be easier in the world than spend public money .  Despite all of the fine rhetoric , all of the wonderful promise , all of the budget bill , the budget deal , the budget reduction package that be debate , vote on , and promise by the Congress , despite all of that , Americans continue to see an ever-escalating debt , hundred of billion of dollar annually of deficit spending , and a frightening explosion in the national debt .  In 1980 , when I be elect to Congress , one of the very first piece of legislation that we have to vote on be whether or not we would raise the national debt ceiling -- that be , that level over which we could not borrow money -- to raise that to $ 1 trillion .  We know , if we be go to reduce that debt , that we could not have any more year of deficit spending .  Automatic spending a a way of meet entitlement obligation clearly have play an enormous role in all of this , some necessary defense increase , some less than project revenue estimate , but primarily a lack of will on the part of the Congress to curb it spend habit and it appetite for spending .  My great disappointment in my year in Congress have be our failure by one vote to join the House of Representatives and pass on to the States for their consideration and , hopefully , their ratification a balanced budget amendment -- one vote .  Now we be look at the second tool to try to curb congressional spending , this appetite for spending , spending , spending , and pay for it not by ask the taxpayer to ante up , although we have do that , and it have I think have a negative effect on our ability to grow and provide opportunity for our young people and job opportunity for Americans .  If a few year , it will exceed the entire spending for national security , for all our military men in uniform , for all that we provide for national defense .  We now come to the second institutional change , the line-item veto .  John McCain manage it one time , and I manage it another time -- alternately introduce the line-item veto under different form -- enhanced rescission we call it .  But we have be offer it in Congress after Congress , year after year , always fall short of the necessary number of vote to break a filibuster , because those who oppose line- item veto , those who believe Congress can exercise the will for fiscal discipline , those who feel that the power of make those decision should not rest anywhere except in this body have be able to block our effort .  But the next best structural change that can take place would be the line-item veto , in this Senator 's opinion , because it be clear the Congress can not muster the will to , on a regular basis or even on an occasional basis , balance the budget .

***** I be honor to be invite to address your committee about what we know and do not know about the effect of marriage and divorce on family and child and about what policy and program might work to promote and strengthen healthy marriage , especially among the poor .  ( 1 ) what we know about the effect of marriage , divorce , and single parenthood on child ; ( 2 ) what we know about the effectiveness of policy and program that seek to stem persistently high rate of divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing ; and ( 3 ) what we know about the likely effect of these policy on low-income family and child .

Single parenthood be not the only , nor even the most important , cause of the high rate of school dropout , teenage pregnancy , juvenile delinquency , or other negative outcome we see ; but it do contribute independently to these problem .  Second , an emerge body of evidence suggest that marital education , family counseling , and related service can improve middle-class couple ’ communication and problem-solving skill , result initially in great marital satisfaction and , in some case , reduce divorce , although these effect appear to fade over time .  Third , we do not know whether these same marital education service would be effective in reduce marital stress and eventual divorce among low-income population or in promoting marriage among the unmarried .  Similarly , about half of all first marriage end in divorce , and when child be involve , many of the result single-parent household be poor .  The strong correlation between grow up in a two-parent family and improve child outcome do not ensure that intervene to encourage more marriage and less divorce will have the intend result .

Spread over every adult citizen , that would support a basic income of approximately $ 2,500 per year .  It might be interest to have someone from the DOE FUND on the programthats a private charity that help undeserving men get their life together and get job skill and get job to become self-sufficient .  If everyone get $ 20,000 by default , maybe it would be hard to find someone to stock the shelf at your local grocery store , because usual job candidate will substitute leisure time .

While the old standard be often criticize for an excessive reliance on memorize certain fact or procedure , the new standard routinely call for student to solve problem that require a strong grasp of mathematical concept and to explain their reasoning .  stand to be one of the big challenge teacher face a they work to implement the new standard , Behrend say .  Students will take practice test align to the new standard this year in preparation for the first statewide assessment tie to Common Core in spring 2015 .  While some teacher be ready to tackle the new standard , others say they have receive scant training in how to teach math a a hands-on , exploration base activity .  “ It ’ s easy ( for teacher ) to focus on memorization of fact and memorization of procedure without really identify the important mathematics ” behind them and teach those concept to student , Behrend say .  Memorization have never be the best way to learn math , Behrend say , but it be often enough to meet many of the old standard .

The decision raise alarm bell across the river , prompt a coalition of 36 Washington state lawmaker to send a letter to fish and wildlife leader express concern about Oregon 's reversal .  Allowing commercial gillnets in the main channel of the river be a `` highly controversial `` move that would `` negatively impact recreational fishery from the river 's mouth to the upper Columbia in Eastern Washington , `` they write .  Kate Brown , to win support of an influential lawmaker with close tie to the commercial fishing industry .  They argue that it 's a natural time to reevaluate river reform set in motion by former Gov .  Johnson say the underlying conflict in Oregon pit commercial fisherman against recreational angler for access to salmon , and that 's just an argument that date to the 1880s .  Path to compromise Oregon and Washington 's path to this uncertain moment be set in motion by Kitzhaber in response to a 2012 ballot measure to ban commercial gillnets from the Columbia River .  The compromise would only allow gillnets on certain channel of the Columbia by 2017 , and set vague conservation goal with promise to `` enhance the economic viability of Oregon 's recreational and commercial fishery and the community that rely on these fishery .
***** Under the 2020 plan , 75 percent of the spring Chinook would be allocate to recreational angler .  with the other 25 percent allocate to the commercial fishery .  Only tangle net would be allow in the mainstem during the commercial spring fishery after the run size update in mid- to late-May .  The summer fishery will feature an 80 percent and 20 percent split for the recreational and commercial fishery , respectively .
***** Measure 81 , which would ban the use of gillnets by nontribal commercial fisherman in the inland water of Oregon , but would allow the use of seine net ( which have be illegal for non tribal commercial fishery on the Columbia River since 1948 ) be the most recent clash in the long and unnecessary battle between recreational and commercial fisherman over allocation of salmon in the low Columbia River .  89 % of the fund use to generate signature for Measure 81 be from a donation of more than $ 500,000 from one resident of Washington State .  The big problem with use the initiative process to change fishery regulation with respect to the Columbia River be that the new regulation would apply only to Oregon commercial fisherman , wholesaler , and processor .  If Measure 81 pa , Washington non-tribal commercial fisherman will continue use gillnets to harvest salmon and sturgeon in the Columbia River .  Another major problem with Measure 81 be that although the author would have you believe otherwise , it merely boil down to an allocation shift of harvest ( and the accompany incidental bycatch ) from the gillnet fishery to the recreational fishery .  The fishery be jointly manage by state ( Oregon and Washington ) , federal , and tribal agency whose overall goal be to conserve threatened and endanger fish population and at the same time , provide maximum opportunity for both recreational and commercial fishing in the Columbia River .  Individual fishing season be set by the Columbia River Interstate Compact , a partnership between the fish and wildlife department of the state of Oregon and Washington who work together to craft concurrent regulation that apply to the Columbia River fishery .  When you average out the total allowable harvest allow to non-tribal fishery , recreational fishery be allocate 80 % of the catch and commercial fisherman get 20 % .  Confusing the issue far , in reaction to Measure 81 , Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber have come up with a somewhat more equitable plan that would phase out non-tribal gillnetting on the main channel of the Columbia River and require the development of alternative fish method such a purse seine for commercial use .  Under this plan , commercial gillnetting in off-channel area such a Youngs Bay would continue .  As well a prevent Oregon commercial fisherman from use gillnets in the inland water of Oregon , Measure 81 would also ban the sale in Oregon of any fish caught by Washington fisherman on the Columbia River .  Although brother Mark and Steve Fick , lifelong Astoria resident , be not descend from a long line of commercial fisherman like some family on the North Coast , they both derive all or much of their livelihood from salmon in the Columbia River .  â€œNotwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing law , it be unlawful to use a gillnet or tangle net to take salmon , steelhead , or other fish in the inland water of the state of Oregon .  â€œNotwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing law , it be unlawful for a wholesaler , canner or buyer to buy or receive salmon , steelhead , or other fish take by a gillnet or tangle net from the inland water of the state of Oregon .  ( Laws enact under Measure 81 would apply to Oregon only , cause differ policy in a joint use area .
***** Commercial setnet fisherman in Alaska 's Cook Inlet , who find themselves under fire from an initiative aim at shut them down , be not alone .  Pacific Coast , it seem , effort be underway to ban or restrict an old commercial fishing gear type that 's unable to discriminate between various specie of salmon .  Commercial fisher in Washington state this summer fail in a court bid to stop a ban on gillnets in the main stem of the Columbia River .  Commercial fisher in Alaska be now consider similar litigation in an attempt to stop the propose ballot initiative impose a set-gillnet ban in non-subsistence area of Alaska .  The Alaska ban be aim primarily at Cook Inlet where gillnets fish huge run of sockeye salmon inadvertently catch diminish number of late-run king salmon bound for the Kenai River .
***** But just enough , commissioner hop , to prompt negotiation with the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission to bring the state back together on co-managing the river 's salmon , and still keep their governor happy .  20 decision to allow continued gill-netting for summer and fall chinook , contrary to a 2013 plan to phase net off the river by the end of 2017 .  They also leave the door open for alternative , safer fish gear in the mainstem , include the limited use of tanglenets in the spring if May review of the spring salmon run show enough fish be available .  Oregon 's law create the plan , he say , require the state to address maximum economic benefit for both commercial and sportfishing .  Without an agreement , the state could remain at odds and , for the first time in nearly 100 year , have to manage the river 's fall fishery separately .  The change come after Brown tell the commission in a February letter Oregon 's plan to keep gill-nets on the river would make enforcement `` complicate , confuse and untenable .

***** In this opinion , we shall refer to these person either a `` plaintiff `` or a `` fixed-gear fisherman `` .  Certain other person , who be owner and operator of appliance for the taking of salmon in the Columbia River of the type call `` float gear `` , specifically , drift gill-nets , and an incorporate labor union whose member be gill-net fisherman in the Columbia River , intervene in the action by permission of the circuit court .  * 470 The initiative act prohibit the taking of salmon , salmon trout or steelhead in any of the water of the Columbia River or it tributary in the state of Oregon by mean of fixed gear , with the proviso that the act do not apply to fishing by Indians under Federal regulation or to the taking of fish for propagation or scientific purpose by the state or national government .  ( 1 ) That section 1 of the act be unconstitutional , in that such section go beyond the scope of the title of the act by prohibit the use of drag seine for any purpose whatever in the water specify , whereas the title of the act define it purpose in this connection to be only the prohibition of the use of drag seine for the taking of salmon in such water .  ( 2 ) That section 3 be unconstitutional , in that it * 471 go beyond the scope of the title of the act by prohibit the use of whip seine for any purpose whatever in say water , whereas the title of the act define it purpose in this connection to be only the prohibition of the use of whip seine for the taking of salmon in such water .  In argument , the government do not deny that California have `` a qualified ownership of land under inland navigable water such a river , harbor , and even tidelands down to the low water mark `` , but do question the rationale of Pollard v .  The compact merely provide that law `` regulating , protect , or preserve fish in the water of the Columbia River , over which the States of Oregon and Washington have concurrent jurisdiction , or any other water within either of say States , which would affect say concurrent jurisdiction , shall be make , change , alter , and amend in whole or in part , only with the mutual consent and approbation of both States .  On the contrary , in 1935 Washington , by initiative process , prohibit the use of fixed-gear appliance , and the Oregon act simply bring this state into line with Washington in that respect .  * 477 Another assert ground of unconstitutionality be that the act be an attempt by Oregon to impair the obligation of it contract with the fixed-appliance fisherman , in violation of Art .  In this connection , the remarkable contention be make that license heretofore issue by the Commission to the fixed-appliance fisherman constitute the latter , under the licensing provision of the Fish Code ( section 83-601 83-619 , O .  The argument be buttress by the contention that the fisherman , on the faith of their license , be `` require to make the expenditure of thousand of dollar in the erection of permanent gear `` , and that the state have benefit to the extent of thousand of dollar from the fisherman 's catch .  The argument be that , in effect , the act grant to gill-net fisherman a monopoly of fishing in the Columbia River .  And in the Radich case there be evidence that gill-net fisherman would not permit anyone to use a certain drift who refuse to submit to a certain amount of regulation in fishing and to bear a part of the expense of clear the drift ground of snag and other obstruction .  `` * * * It will perhaps be sufficient to say that the unreasonableness and arbitrariness complain of consist in the prohibiting of the taking of fish from the Pacific Ocean and river and harbor adjacent thereto by mean of a purse seine , while permit fish to be take therefrom with set net , pound net , gill net , and drag seine ; * * * It seem too plain to justify lengthy discussion that this contention present a legislative , not a judicial , question .  It be insist , moreover , that the court may not presume that the people of Oregon give to the measure the care , consideration and study that the legislature presumably would have give it .  The low court hold that the title of the act define it purpose only a prohibit the taking of salmon by the use of drag seine , whereas section 1 of the act go beyond the scope of the title in that it make it unlawful to operate drag seine for any purpose .

***** I 've see more substance in tale about `` the one that get away `` than Steve Pedery 's July 23 op-ed tout the ballot measure to ban the use of gill net by Oregon commercial fisherman ( ) .  He fail to mention that this measure be primarily support by Washington state interest or that a single Washington sport fisherman contribute more than half a million dollar -- or 89 percent -- of the fund to put this measure on the ballot .  This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fisherman .  Washington commercial fisherman would still be allow to use gill net on the Columbia River .  It simply reallocate the exist commercial fisherman 's share of salmon and sturgeon to .  It 's amazing when you consider that the sportfishing industry have catch 80 percent of the Columbia River spring chinook salmon , while commercial fisherman have catch only 20 percent of these fish over the past 10 year , accord to number from the Oregon and Washington Departments of Fish and Wildlife .  Now a small group of sportfishing interest want 100 percent of the catch and be willing to put commercial fishing family in Oregon out of business to get what it want .  Of course , Oregon 's commercial fisherman do n't fish for themselves .  The commercial fleet be the consumer 's fleet .  In fact , this measure specifically forbids Oregonians from buy these Columbia River fish in their fish market , grocery store and restaurant -- even if they be catch legally by Washington commercial fisherman .  Commercial fisherman would n't be allow to fish if they be a threat to the Columbia 's salmon and sturgeon population .  Voters should n't abandon the scientific management of the Columbia salmon harvest in order to create a monopoly for sport fisherman at the expense of Oregon consumer .

Washington commercial fisherman would still be allow to use gill net on the Columbia River , `` she write .  `` Is it true that the measure restrict Oregon fisherman on the same river where Washington fisherman would not be restrict ? `` .  Would a ban , if approve by Oregon voter , only apply to Oregon fisherman but exempt Washington fisherman ? .

The House of Representatives have now adopt the conference report , and so it be now hopefully go to be before u after a cloture vote .  Another provision which will go into effect immediately upon enactment would allow the Secretary of Defense to use fund from the CERP in Afghanistan to pay for reintegration program to separate local Taliban fighter from their leader .  This be a new program model on the Sons of Iraq Program which be so successful in get large number of young Iraqis who have be attack u to switch side and support the government .  These be two program which I think people strongly support regardless of their position on the question of strategy and the troop level .  For all these reason , I would urge our colleague to vote for cloture on the conference report and then to adopt the conference report itself .  The conference report largely support the defense priority lay out by Secretary Gates and authorize over $ 550 billion in base program funding for the Department of Defense and the national security program of the Department of Energy .

I believe additional oversight be especially need in the military presence a it expand and foreign assistance program be increase to make sure that we be use those fund effectively in that fight .  I , frankly , do not know what I be go to do on your supplemental request because I be very concerned that it be go to wind up with u stick in a problem that nobody know how to get out of .  I mean , I understand that the goal , rather than have some grandiose set of goal , the goal in Afghanistan be simply to demolish al Qaeda so they do not provide a threat to u .  And my other problem , since people be also talk about the possibility of an IMF replenishment , during the year I chair this subcommittee , I put a lot of IMF money through the Congress , but I have to tell you , I have great reluctance to do so give the fact that the Western European government , especially Germany , be decline to provide the kind of economic stimulus that the world seem to expect of u but which they do not seem to be willing to deliver themselves .  We be ask for small investment target to specific concern , international peacekeeping operation and stabilization in Africa ; humanitarian need in Burma ; the dismantlement of North Korea 's nuclear program , assume they come back to the Six-Party Talks ; assistance for Georgia that the prior administration promise that we believe we should fulfill ; support for the Lebanese Government , which be face serious challenge ; fund for critical air mobility support in Mexico a part of the Merida Initiative .  So I believe , Congresswoman , that there be a significant opportunity here for u , work in collaboration with the Pakistani Government , to help them get the support they need to make that mind-set change and act more vigorously against this threat .  The nuclear program have continue unabated .

***** Bush and Michelle Nunn 6 Key vote 6 .

Neither of the major party candidate have hold an elected office before .  A primary election be an election in which register voter select a candidate that they believe should be a political party 's candidate for elected office to run in the general election .

MMTers go beyond endogenous money theory , however , and argue that government should never have to default so long a it ’ s sovereign in it currency .  The US government , for instance , can ’ t go bankrupt because that would mean it run out of dollar to pay creditor ; but it can ’ t run out of dollar , because it be the only agency allow to create dollar .

We find that the relationship between negative income shock and mortgage default illustrate in Figure 1 held for homeowner across all level of home equity and regardless of income level or total debt-to-income ratio ( DTI ) at origination .  3 million mortgage foreclosure between 2008 and 2013 and therefore act a an automatic stabilizer for the housing market during this period .

The FPC ’ s mortgage market Recommendations limit the proportion of new mortgage with high loan to income ratio , guard against an increase in the number of highly indebted household .

***** X The Covid-19 public health crisis have sharply reduce the earnings of million of U .  Moreover , a wave of missed payment on mortgage and other type of household debt could propagate through the financial system—weakening financial institution , unnerve investor , and far prolong the economic slump .  1 Federal regulator and Congress have already enact some policy to provide relief to households struggle to make payment on mortgage and student debt .  Our goal be to provide insight into the potential role of policy in improve outcome for mortgage borrower during the Covid-19 crisis .  The specific type of assistance to mortgage borrower must correspond to the nature of the economic shock .  In general , payment relief be a more effective way to help struggle mortgage borrower than debt forgiveness .  2 In addition , more than half a decade of home price gain mean that the vast majority of homeowner could withstand a 20 % drop in price without go into negative equity .  3 The mortgage finance system have also evolve .  3 million foreclosure , which in turn help stabilize the mortgage market .
***** We discuss servicers ' incentive and the obstacle to work out delinquent mortgage .  First , affordable solution be more difficult to achieve for borrower with these loan than for those with prime mortgage .  Second , these loan be generally fund by private-label mortgage back security , for which investor provide little or no guidance to servicers about what modification be appropriate .  More generally , investor be wary that modification might turn out to be unsuccessful , thus delay and increase ultimate loss .  Foreclosures , loss mitigation activity , and loss from foreclosure Servicers have be increase the number of workout of delinquent or probable delinquent mortgage , but delinquency and foreclosure start have continue to rise rapidly .  They have increase modification , which involve permanent change to the mortgage contract , and have rely relatively less on repayment plan , which allow borrower to make up missed payment in installment .  Given loss rate to investor from foreclose subprime mortgage of 50 percent or more , both investor and borrower could be good off with more effective loss mitigation .  But such economy of scale be not present in loss mitigation , which generally require more labor-intensive process , such a as whether a financial setback be temporary or permanent and , in turn , determine the appropriate loss-mitigation option .  In addition , some investor fear that modification will not be successful and will ultimately cost them more by delay a timely resolution of loss at a time when house price continue to fall .  Indeed , the investor with whom we speak do not widely convey concern that servicers be rely too heavily on foreclosure relative to loan modification .  Loss mitigation of loan in GSE pool Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( F/F ) guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage in their pool .

***** At the same time , the coverage of collective bargaining , and the number of worker who be member of trade union have fall .  In other country ( such a Germany and Austria and more recently Spain ) , sectoral agreement dominate but they leave room for firm-level agreement to apply less favourable term for employee , either in a generalised way or only temporarily in case of a crisis .  This process of collective representation , negotiation and decision-making be a key labour market institution and , together with the “ right to organise ” , be a “ fundamental principle and right at work ” set by the ILO Convention No .  4 Indeed , while often consider mainly a a wage set institution , collective bargaining also play an important role for set other condition of employment such a job security , working-time regulation , occupational safety and health , provision or access to training ( Chapter 4 explores in more detail the effect of collective bargaining on these non-monetary aspect ) .  if and where wage , hire and fire rule , occupational health and safety , work time be set by collective bargaining and if collective agreement also cover train and/or unemployment insurance ) ; iv ) collective bargaining and non-standard form of work ( if and how social partner and collective bargaining also cover flexible form of work ) ; and v ) recent change ( if any ) in collective bargaining .
***** Act 10 in Wisconsin , push by Governor Scott Walker and pa in 2011 , strip public service worker of the right to negotiate over basically everything except an annual cost of live adjustment .  In such a scheme , worker currently cover by the contract will keep all aspect of what theyve win , but employee hire after the contract be ratify will be force to accept cheap , less standard .  Its also a terrific way to find free or very affordable location for bargaining .  Lewis ( 2018 ; this case consolidate two other related case both deal with force arbitration clause use to gut worker right to class action lawsuit , among other egregious implication ) UNION PROFILE The New Jersey Education Association , a statewide affiliate of the 3-million-member National Education Association ( NEA ) , represent over 200,000 teacher and educational support professional with local association in every K-12 school district in New Jersey .  [ 2 ] By design , Chapter 78 severely weaken the union bargain position on healthcare and impose the exorbitant cost of coverage that be all too familiar to so many private sector worker onto public sector worker a well .  Over the next several year , a collective bargaining agreement for local school district expire , trigger the bill phase-in , teacher and other school district employee begin to see the salary increase they have negotiate wipe out by state-mandated healthcare contribution .  As staff support come in from the statewide union , Larsen and DeVicaris werent dogmatic about how local association approach the change .
***** More generally , business owner be use to be in charge , and they do n't want to be hassle by people they have come to think of as mere employee , not a breadwinner for their family or citizen of the same city and country .  Employees want business to pay high tax to government , and they often want government to regulate business in way that help employee .  Their credo emphasize citizenship right , action in support of general social progress , cooperative form of organization for the society a a whole , and , significantly , the inclusion of worker of all craft and race in one union for the first time ( Voss 1993 , pp .  The top leader be ambivalent about strike because disruptive action alienate both employer and the general public , so at first they tend to focus on education , persuasion , and legislative change .  But a the union leader expect , the employer nonetheless continue to resist the union pay scale , elaborate work rule , and apprenticeship limit that skilled craft worker want to retain in the workplace .  The result be a political division in the working class , with immigrant industrial worker tend to support the pro-immigrant Republicans from 1896 to the late 1920s , while member of the AFL be more likely to vote Democratic because urban political machine be more tolerant of union ( Mink 1986 , p .  First , there be the several intensely violent conflict between worker and employee that be discuss in the previous section .  Then , too , some small business , especially in bituminous coal mining , think that union that could insist on a minimum wage might be one way to limit the vicious wage competition that plague their industry ( Gordon 1994 ; Ramirez 1978 ) .  At first glance , the NCF focus on collective bargaining may seem to reflect the corporate moderate ' acceptance of an equal relation between capital and labor in a pluralistic American context , which would not fit with the theory of corporate dominance reflect in this document , and on this site more generally .
***** The impact of change in public-sector bargaining law on district ’ spending on teacher compensation .  be Building Worker Power The impact of change in public-sector bargaining law on district ’ spending on teacher compensation Summary What this paper find .  Legislative measure restrict public-sector collective bargaining right enact in Idaho , Indiana , Michigan , Tennessee , and Wisconsin in 2011 and 2012 significantly reduce school district spend on teacher compensation , include both teacher salary and teacher benefit .  state in the last decade that also substantially restrict public-sector bargaining right .  For private-sector worker , the exercise of collective bargaining right be regulate by the country ’ s fundamental labor law , the 1935 National Labor Relations Act ( NLRA ) and the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) establish to administer and enforce the NLRA .  2 For public-sector employee , there be no one national labor law or administrative body govern the entirety of collective bargaining right .  Over half of union worker in the United States be in the public sector , and public school teacher make up the single large group of public-sector unionized employee ( Wolf and Schmitt 2018 ) .
***** The ACLU continue to support the right of employee , both public and private , to organize union and bargain collectively .  Collective bargaining statute provide critical and necessary protection for worker who exercise basic civil right , in particular , the right of speech , association , and petition .  What be the right to collective bargaining ? .  The right to collective bargaining be the right of individual employee in a workplace to come together and to choose a representative , base on a majority vote , who will then negotiate with their employer over term and condition of employment .  Why be the right to form a union and engage in collective bargaining civil liberty ? .
***** How corporate practice and legal change have undercut the ability of worker to organize and bargain Part of the Unequal Power project , an EPI initiative to reestablish the understanding in law , politics , economics , and philosophy , that equal bargaining power between worker and employer do not exist .  Supreme Court , which issue a series of decision restrict worker ’ right and limit employer ’ bargaining obligation .  Efforts during the Great Society period , when Democrats be at their peak congressional power , and under each successive Democratic president—Carter in 1978 , Clinton in 1993 , and Obama in 2009—to strengthen the NLRA ’ s protection of worker ’ right to collective bargaining be all defeat , despite majority support in both the House and Senate and by the president .  In the paper final section we review recent study that reveal that a substantial share of the nonunion workforce desire collective bargaining during the pivotal 1970s , especially Black worker , and that this unmet demand for collective bargaining have escalate in recent year such that nearly half of nonunion worker , include those who be supervisor and ineligible , would vote to have union representation in their current job if give an opportunity to do so .  We also be not able to explore fully the argument that union miss the opportunity open by the civil and woman right movement to diversify their rank , and that the individual right framework that undergird these movement prove strong than the collective New Deal framework that build union and labor law ( Lichtenstein 2013 ; Frymer 2008 ) .  ii Much of the erosion of currently represent union worker reflect the fundamental rule of labor law that establish a a default rule representation at the individual-unit level of enterprise and do nothing to facilitate representation right at the occupation or industry level , make maintain union coverage exceedingly difficult , We also do not account for the increase in the number of job in category that often fall outside of collective bargaining coverage , such a supervisor and contingent , contractual , or temporary worker .
***** [ 2 ] This report provide state and local policymakers with guidance on how to combat this attack on worker ’ right , offer policy to ensure that public sector worker be free to come together in strong union .  [ 7 ] Despite this , union membership rate have be in decline since the middle of the last century a attack on bargaining right have escalate .  Quinn decision and the rollback of collective bargaining protection in several Midwestern state , have lead to significant reduction in public sector unionization rate .  [ 13 ] This willingness to push the boundary of the law in order to win good work condition echo the public sector radicalism that lead to the creation of the first state and local law recognize government worker ’ bargain right .  [ 15 ] In an April 2018 Ipsos/NPR poll , just 26 percent of Americans agree with the statement that “ public school teacher be pay fairly .  ” [ 16 ] Moreover , three-quarters of the poll ’ s respondent say that public school teacher have a right to strike .  At the federal level , Congress should enact legislation to extend bargaining right to all government worker and strengthen federal law in many of the way describe in this report .  It discuss the history of government intervention to allow public sector worker to bargain ; outline the positive benefit of strong public sector union to all work family ; and , most importantly , propose concrete change that city and state can adopt in order to support public employee ’ bargain right .
***** Fairfax County and Arlington have consider increase their upcoming budget to accommodate for collective bargaining in light of the change in law .  Although public worker retain the right to organize and meet with their jurisdiction to present issue of concern , jurisdiction be not legally obligate to respond .  The City use the COVID-19 pandemic a an example for the need to limit the scope say “ the government need to have flexibility to adjust and change a external influence and need surface… .
***** William Petroski , and Brianne Pfannenstiel Des Moines Register Despite staunch Democratic opposition that fuel three day of contentious debate , the Iowa Legislature on Thursday give final approval to a bill that will dramatically scale back a four-decades-old collective bargaining law that govern union contract negotiation for the state ’ s public worker .  AFSCME Iowa leader promise lawsuit challenge collective bargaining change Tammy Wawro , president of the 34,000-member Iowa State Education Association , which represent Iowa teacher , say she do n't believe any Republican legislator campaign on make major change in Iowa 's collective bargaining law .  Terry Branstad , a Republican who have have repeat battle with public employee ' union , be expect to sign the bill .  The House support the bill 53-47 , while the Senate give final passage 29-21 .
***** Under the civil service , once an employee have pass a probationary period , their position in the civil service become permanent .  Many public sector employee must go through a somewhat similar hire process a the state civil service in order to determine if a candidate be qualify for a position .  Types of employee who be most commonly exclude from the collective bargaining process include manager , supervisor , and other employee involve in make management decision or develop management position at bargaining .  These employee generally include manager or supervisor and staff who be involve in develop an employer position in the collective bargaining process .  Most public employee be pay a monthly salary ; however , some public employee be pay wage on an hourly basis for time work .  The reason for the variation depend on a variety of factor , include the level of the benefit provide , the degree to which employer prefundedor set asideretirement benefit over the course of an employee career , and past investment return on any money that have be set aside for this purpose .
***** Protecting public worker ’ right be crucial for create thriving workplace and community .  But in many state , public worker do not have the right to collectively bargain with their public employer .  Violating public worker ’ right to collectively bargain be not only unjust to the worker , it be unjust to the community they serve .  UE be commit to fight for public worker ’ right to collectively bargain and fight for those worker in state where collective bargaining be ban or nonexistent .  Collective bargaining be a right for all worker .
***** By a 5-to-4 vote , with the more conservative justice in the majority , the court rule that government worker who choose not to join union may not be require to help pay for collective bargaining .  “ We conclude that this arrangement violate the free speech right of nonmember by compel them to subsidize private speech on matter of substantial public concern , ” he write .
***** However , this right have often be restrict for public service worker and in recent year have come under attack .  EPSU be very grateful to the European Trade Union Institute for coordinate the production of factsheets on 35 country , set out the legal provision on the right to strike , identify in particular specific rule affect the public service .  As the 35 country factsheets show , there be often considerable limitation on the right to strike in public service .  Procedural rule and requirement to provide minimum level of essential service can also far limit their right .  In July 2018 , member of the UK public and commercial service PCS union deliver the high “ yes ” vote and turnout in the union ’ s history .  However , the vote be invalid because of restriction on public sector strike action introduce by the centre-right Conservative government in 2016 .
***** Public-sector union now have to win support from a majority of employee in the bargaining unit , not just a majority of those vote in the certification election .  In 1959 , state lawmaker hand teacher collective bargaining right they have not even seek .  ” The 1993 change allow school district to limit annual benefit and salary increase to 3 .
***** Recognizing the burden that such benefit would place on New Jersey 's long-term finance , Christie have seek instead to impose a one-year wage freeze , to change pension rule to limit future benefit , and to require that teacher contribute a tiny fraction of their salary to cover the cost of their health insurance measure that , for private-sector worker , would be mostly uncontroversial .  The Bureau of Labor Statistics report that , in 2009 , for the first time ever , more public-sector employee ( 7 .  ( Differences in state and local law of course mean that the percentage varies from state to state ; New York top the chart with roughly 70 % of state employee in union , while many Southern right-to-work state hover in the single digit .  To tolerate or recognize any combination of civil service employee of the government a a labor organization or union be not only incompatible with the spirit of democracy , but inconsistent with every principle upon which our government be find .
***** Public employee seek a voice at work that they ’ ve lack for 10 year - Wisconsin Examiner Politics & GovernmentWork & the Economy Public employee seek a voice at work that they ’ ve lack for 10 year For ten of thousand of Wisconsin worker who lose most or all of their right on the job a decade ago , one provision in Gov .  Looming large in conversation with a cross section of government employee eager to see the governor ’ s proposal enact be it potential to bring back the opportunity to have a say in the way they do their work .  Scott Walker , strip all but the most rudimentary union right for most public employee .  ‘ Eviscerates the union ’ Even more than the economic part of Act 10 — which unilaterally increase what public employee have to pay out of pocket for health care and retirement benefit and impose a ceiling on what their union could negotiate for wage increase — the ban on negotiate work condition gutted the right of state and local worker .
***** com The controversial bill rewrite Iowa ’ s law on collective bargaining right for public worker be now law .  This bill also give local government , school and state government great freedom in manage their resource with the opportunity to reward good public employee .
***** The passage of 2011 Act 10 and , to a less degree , 2011 Act 32 , be watershed event that dramatically change collective bargaining for all Wisconsin municipal employer .  Local municipal employer have use these “ tool ” — some to great and vary degree than others — to achieve substantial cost saving and operational efficiency , and to develop sustainable compensation and benefit package for their employee that reflect the labor market in a time of reduced government revenue stream .  ” Act 10 also allow the municipal employer to impose it last best offer once the party reach impasse , thereby eliminate interest arbitration for general municipal employee .  Effective use of this virtually unrestricted freedom have allow most municipal employer to change wage and benefit , but also to completely change how service be provide , and how employee be evaluate .  While not a extensive , through Act 32 , the Legislature make meaningful change to collective bargaining for public safety bargain unit .  While the legislature have preserve most of the traditional scope of bargain for public safety union , and preserve the traditional access to interest arbitration to resolve dispute , it have be the change to the negotiability of one critical issue , health insurance , that have generate the most significant impact on how negotiation in those unit be carry out .
***** States have decimate the right of public sector worker who , unlike private sector worker , do not have federal protection ensure their freedom to organize and collectively bargain .

***** Louis , Missouri 4National Consortium on Violence Research Sections Abstract Key Words INTRODUCTIONTRENDS IN HOMICIDEFACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN THE HOMICIDE RATEROLE OF THE BIG CITIESSOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT CAUSES OF THE DECLINECONCLUSIONS LITERATURE CITED Abstract ▪ Abstract A dramatic rise in homicide in the latter half of the 1980s peak during the 1990s and then decline at an equally dramatic rate .  Such trend in homicide rate can be understand only by examine rate in specific age , sex , and racial group .  The increase primarily involve young male , especially black male , occur first in the big city , and be relate to the sudden appearance of crack cocaine in the drug market of the big city around 1985 .  This development lead to an increase need for and use of gun and be accompany by a general diffusion of gun into the large community .  The decline in homicide since the early 1990s have be cause by change in the drug market , police response to gun carry by young male , especially those under 18 year old , the economic expansion , and effort to decrease general access to gun , as well a an increase in the prison population and a continued decline in homicide among those over age 24 .  The lesson learn from the recent homicide trend and the factor associate with them have important implication for public health and the criminal justice system .  It be project that , without a change in the trend , firearm would overtake motor vehicle a the lead cause of injury and death in the United States by the year 2000 ( 17 ) .  The reason for the rise in homicide in the latter half of the 1980s , peak in the early 1990s , and the subsequent equally dramatic decline span both criminology and public health ( 10 ) .  In this review , we first describe trend in homicide victimization and offenses over the last 20 year and then explore the reason for the increase in the late 1980s and the subsequent decrease in the 1990s .  We limit our attention to homicide because more detailed and reliable data be available for this offense than for other violent crime and because , a a cause of death , homicide be more in the purview of public health than crime such a robbery .  Nonetheless , with few exception , the pattern we observe for homicide also characterize robbery and serious assault ( 11 ) .

***** First , thank you , Doug and Ginger , and thank you , lady and gentleman , for come .  One hundred and thirty-three million Americans , or three out of four Americans with private health insurance , have insurance policy with lifetime limit , which mean they can outrun their limit if they have someone in their family really sick .  So I favor guaranteed private insurance with good benefits—including primary and preventive care and mental health benefit and alcohol and drug abuse benefit , because all these thing will save u money over the long run—no lifetime limit , and insurance that ca n't be take away .  More and more people be lose the right to choose their doctor , actually be force to give up their family doctor and go to someone else .  To deal with the problem I mention up at the beginning of this talk , it would be illegal to drop coverage or cut benefit , increase rate for people who have someone in their family who 'd be sick , use lifetime limit to cut off benefit , or charge old worker more than young one .  Some young worker be upset about that , but I 'm convinced it 's the right choice for our country .  universal guarantee private insurance ; maintain the choice of doctor ; leave Medicare the way it be ; require employer and employee who do n't cover now to take up their own coverage , but provide discount for small business ; the Government would have a pool to pay for the discount and to cover the unemployed , uninsured ; add prescription drug ; and phase in a longterm care benefit for the elderly people on Medicare and for the disabled , which I think be quite important .  But we have to set up a system that stop this hemorrhaging and give small business and self-employed people the right to buy insurance on the same term that big business and Government can .  First of all , this health care plan will not take away from you any benefit you now have .  When these law be pass , you do n't have teenager go around gun people down like you do now .

***** Rick Perry use federal stimulus money to pay 97 percent of Texas 's budget shortfall in fiscal 2010 -- which be funny , because Perry spend a lot of time talk about just how terrible the stimulus be .  In fact , Texas be the state that rely most heavily on stimulus fund , CNN 's Tami Luhby report .  `` Thanks to the stimulus fund , Texas do n't have to dip into it $ 9 .  Still , now that the stimulus be spend , Texas , like many other state , be face severe cut -- $ 31 million must be carve from the budget .
***** Rick Perry and state lawmaker must close a budget deficit of as much a $ 27 billion .  He vocally oppose the Obama administration 's 2009 stimulus program to spur the economy and assist cash-strapped state .  Perry also like to trumpet that his state balance it budget in 2009 , while keep billion in it rainy day fund .  Turns out Texas be the state that depend the most on those very stimulus fund to plug nearly 97 % of it shortfall for fiscal 2010 , accord to the National Conference of State Legislatures .  Even budget deficit be big in TexasTexas , which craft a budget every two year , be face a $ 6 .
***** Send truckloads of federal dollar to the state .  When President Barack Obama take office in January 2009 during the throe of the Great Recession , tax revenue be collapse and state budget be hemorrhage .  So the president propose an unprecedented $ 200 billion in direct aid to state , a desperate effort to stop the bleeding that amount to one-fourth of his entire stimulus request .  Republican leader have already decide to oppose any Obama stimulus .  And even Washington Democrats who support their new leader ’ s stimulus weren ’ t excite to help Republican governor balance their budget .  And since state fiscal relief be a relatively new concept , the Obama team ’ s belief that it would provide powerful economic stimulus be more hunch-based than evidence-based .  Ultimately , the Democratic Congress approve $ 140 billion in state aid—only two-thirds of Obama ’ s original ask , but far more than any previous stimulus .  Now that Congress be once again debate stimulus for a crushed economy—and governor be once again confront with gigantic budget shortfalls—a partisan war be break out over state aid .  Some of the partisan argument against state aid have be flagrantly hostile to economic evidence ; Walker ’ s op-ed actually blame the state budget shortfall after the Great Recession on “ the disappearance of federal stimulus fund , ” rather than the recession itself , a if the stimulus fund somehow create the hole by fail to continue to plug them .
***** Among these be a second round of federal stimulus .  “ There ’ s a huge need out there [ for more stimulus ] , ” Williams say .  And , with the November election approaching , even some of the Senate ’ s Democrats be hesitant to approve of additional stimulus money .  an unfortunate fact for the Lone Star State , which be face an estimate deficit of $ 18 billion for the 2012-2013 budget cycle .  Jim Dunnam believe the first stimulus suffer from a lack of communication .  “ It would have be possible for Texas to have use the stimulus money that we get to do some thing that be one-time expenditure that would have really put in some innovative program .
***** - Even if Congress approve a massive $ 825 billion economic stimulus package , state would still be leave with billion of dollar of budget gap to close on their own , a new analysis release Jan .  The House Democrats version of a stimulus plan set aside more than $ 300 billion for state , raise some speculation that the infusion of federal money would wipe out just about all of the state collective deficit , peg at $ 350 billion by some estimate .  While the House plan do send more than $ 300 billion to the state , at least half of that money could not be spend to plug hole in their budget , the Washington D .  States would be require to pass along billion of federal dollar in the House plan , for example , to local government , themselves face steep budget problem .  Billions of dollar also be designate for infrastructure project , which typically be part of state capital budget , rather than state operate budget .
***** ( Texas , unlike the federal government and many state , have a two-year budget cycle .  After month of criticize the fiscal policy of the Obama administration and tout the hard work that Texas and state like ours have do to make prudent fiscal decision , Perry wind up face a budget fiasco on par with that in California .  Perrys previous budget would also have be in significantly bad shape be it not for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( i .  the stimulus ) , which the Texas legislature use to balance it budget , even a Perry score ton of political point grandstand against a small portion of the fund .  And a it turn out , accord to a report from the National Conference of State Legislatures , Texas rely more heavily on stimulus funding to fill it budget hole than any other state .
***** There be also several instance in which the candidate reiterate claim that we have already find to be false or mislead on such issue a the 2009 stimulus plan and the 2010 federal health care law .  The Minnesota Republican also be inaccurate when she say that Perrys order would have mean girl would be force to have a government injection .  Bachmann also stretch the truth when she say the maker of the vaccine make million because of the order .  The drug company give thousand of dollar in political donation to the governor , and this be just flat-out wrong .  Merck also donate $ 10,000 to Perrys campaign for governor in 2004 ; and another $ 5,000 when he run in 2002 .
***** Rick Perry like to rail against the Obama administration 's `` fail `` federal stimulus program , but he and state lawmaker have more than $ 17 billion in fed-stim dollar to thank for the last two balance Texas budget .  the perfidy of the roughly $ 800 billion stimulus plan orchestrate by the Obama administration in 2009 .  Washingtons insatiable desire to spend our childrens inheritance on failed stimulus plan and other misguided economic theory have give u record debt and leave u with far too many unemployed , Perry say in his announcement speech in South Carolina on Saturday .  `` We be fee up with bailout after bailout and stimulus plan after stimulus plan , each one of which toss principle out the window along with taxpayer money .  4 billion in federal stimulus money include $ 8 billion of the one-time dollar to fund state expense that recur over and over .  In fact , Texas use the federal stimulus to balance it last two budget .  Texas do n't apply for education grant that come with condition , and the governor famously refuse $ 556 million in federal stimulus fund for the state 's unemployment insurance program , say the condition that come along with the cash would increase the long-term cost of the program .  As it turn out , instead of get Texas through a short rough patch , the stimulus money merely buy the state some time , which run out when lawmaker turn to the 2012-13 budget earlier this year .
***** Balancing the state ’ s 2012-2013 budget -- a require by the Texas Constitution -- depend on the passage of the school finance measure , which would delay payment to district and reduce the amount the law say the state must pay district .  The state have a two-year budget cycle .  “ This legislature will go down in the history book a the bad for public education in a generation , ” Villarreal say in a statement on Tuesday .
***** He 's a longtime Perry critic and he be promise to tell America about the underside of Perry 's Texas record , include call Perry out on his use of stimulus dollar .  `` This be the governor who write a not very best-seller call Fed Up , ' but rely on every federal dollar he could get to balance his budget , `` Rep .  As Texas law require , Perry have sign balance budget a governor , make what he admit be tough cut to education and health care in the process , all the while say Washington should cut spending like Texas do .

By say he would never not vote pro-life , he have it both ways—supporters can say that he support force woman to give birth regardless of the circumstance , yet when opponent say he would do that , they point to his lack of public statement to support that argument .  There be no reference to abortion a an issue on Ryans campaign website , and only one news clip even mention it in his medium section .

***** Joshua BlankSince the political rise of the pro-life movement in the 1990s , it ’ s often be suggest that elect Republicans be less seriously commit to ban abortion than their public pronouncement may have convey .

The reason for the Texas GOP ’ s leap forward on abortion restirctions after a decade of chip away at access be likely many , and worthy of their own piece of analysis ( but the partisan sorting of college and non-college educated voter ; the change in composition of the supreme court ; the recent fend off of Democratic challenge in the state ; and the chance to reinforce exist electoral advantage through redistricting in an increasingly competitive state be some possibility that come to mind ) , but look directly ahead to the next set of Texas election in 2022 , the sudden change in the reproductive health landscape beg the question .  where do Texas voter stand on abortion ? .  So despite the fact that the Texas Legislature pass one of the most restrictive abortion law in the country , it ’ s not really fair to describe Texas a a “ pro-life ” state give an electorate that be clearly divide — at least in it description of itself .  Only a small minority of Texas voter would entirely eliminate access to abortion .

I've issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling.
***** Posted inGovernment & Politics , Opinion “ We don ’ t ground all plane ” analogy crash and burn On March 31 , President Barack Obama surprise many when he announce plan to lift oil drill moratorium along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts .  Then 10 day after that , on April 30 , a the scope of the disaster widen , Obama temporarily shelve his plan to expand new offshore drilling pending a 30 day safety review .  Four week later , Obama decide to extend the deepwater drill moratorium six more month , until a presidential commission complete it investigation .  It be late April when I begin notice the follow analogy use to counter argument in favor of a drilling moratorium .  That offshore drilling be safe because “ not one drop be spill ” after the hurricane pa .  It ’ s open for debate whether a lengthy drilling moratorium in the wake of the Macondo disaster be a prudent move .
***** Department of the Interior today issue a directive to oil and gas lessee and operator on the Outer Continental Shelf notify them of requirement under the six month deepwater drill moratorium that Secretary Salazar have order .  “ The six month moratorium on deepwater drilling will provide time to implement new safety requirement and to allow the Presidential Commission to complete it work , ” say Salazar .  “ Deepwater production from the Gulf of Mexico will continue subject to close oversight and safety requirement , but deepwater drilling operation must safely come to a halt .  With the BP oil spill still grow in the Gulf , and investigation and review still underway , a six month pause in drilling be need , appropriate , and prudent .  Salazar 's determination that deepwater drilling activity on new well must cease , and that MMS will not process APDs accordingly , be base on the recommendation in the May 27 , 2010 report from Secretary Salazar to President Obama , Increased Safety Measures for Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf .
***** Deepwater Drilling ’ s Future The Gulf of Mexico oil spill spotlight the growth of deepwater drilling and the challenge of balance strong environmental regulation with effort to expand U .  production in the near term will come from Gulf deepwater field similar to the site of the Deepwater Horizon spill , which currently represent about 70 percent of all Gulf oil production .  Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) report forecast production ( PDF ) in the Gulf of Mexico show that a shallow-water production level have fall , deepwater production have take up the slack .  What be drive the industry to pursue deepwater project ? .  The upward trend in deepwater Gulf project be mirror around the world a oil company look for new source of production amid high oil price and grow global demand .  Production from unconventional source such a oil sand be on the rise , and deepwater drilling be consider one of the last frontier in oil exploration .  The oil industry publication RigZone , say the `` rift in the rig market underscore how oil company that be hard-pressed to find new oil reserve be still willing to spend big , a long a it ’ s in such frontier region a offshore Brazil , West Africa , and the deepwater U .  water to offshore drilling , end a decades-long moratorium .  After the oil spill , however , the administration halt new leasing in the Gulf and elsewhere , and in May issue a six-month moratorium suspend the construction of thirty-three deepwater exploratory well in the Gulf .  An inter-agency report issue in mid-September estimate the drilling hold result in a temporary loss of 20 percent of oil rig job ( PDF ) and up to twelve thousand job total in the Gulf .  A few analyst even contend the oil spill could become a deepwater version of Three Mile Island , the 1979 accident that bring an end to nuclear power plant construction in the United States , and from which the industry have yet to recover .  A review of the BP spill by the British parliament release in January 2011 find that the country ’ s offshore liabilty limit of $ 250 million be insufficient but that `` a moratorium on offshore drilling in the UK Continental Shelf would cause drilling rig and expertise to migrate to other part of the globe .
***** That 's why we 've decide to separate the people who permit offshore lease , who collect revenue , and who regulate the safety of drilling .  In addition , we 've place a 6-month moratorium on drill new deepwater oil and gas well in the Outer Continental Shelf .  And I 'm direct them to report back in 6 month with option for how we can prevent and mitigate the impact of any future spill that result from offshore drilling .

The Obama administration on Monday unveil a retooled moratorium on deepwater drill intend to withstand legal attack by the oil and gas industry , which in May win a federal court injunction block an early six-month moratorium .  To blunt the industry 's argument that it be be `` arbitrary and capricious `` in it decision to suspend all deepwater drilling , the Department of Interior be try a new tack .  The administration have not be able to convince the federal judge that all drilling in water over 500 foot deep be dangerous .  “ More than 80 day into the BP oil spill , a pause on deepwater drilling be essential and appropriate to protect community , coast , and wildlife from the risk that deepwater drill currently pose , ” say Ken Salazar , Secretary of the Interior , in a statement .  “ I be base my decision on evidence that grow every day of the industry ’ s inability in the deepwater to contain a catastrophic blowout , respond to an oil spill , and to operate safely .  ” The new pause on deepwater drilling , the department say , would give time for .  Collect and analyze evidence data on the potential cause of the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig , include input from the presidential commission and congressional investigation .  The suspension be need because of `` an extensive record of exist and new information indicating that allow new deepwater drilling to commence would pose a threat of serious , irreparable , or immediate harm or damage to the marine , coastal , and human environment .  “ This moratorium will reduce oil spill risk while the Gulf will continue to produce oil .

An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior be to provide recommendation for conduct drilling activity in the Gulf .  The six month moratorium on deepwater drilling will provide time to implement new safety requirement and to allow the Presidential Commission to complete it work .  Deepwater production from the Gulf of Mexico will continue subject to close oversight and safety requirement , but deepwater drilling operation must safely come to a halt .
***** The six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico follow the Deepwater Horizon disaster have force oil & gas company to redraw their plan for the rest of the year .  The Obama administration call a halt to deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in late May , a month after the well blowout at the BP-operated Macondo prospect in Mississippi Canyon block 252 destroy the Deepwater Horizon rig , kill 11 and precipitate the bad oil spill in US history .  The time out - which include a halt to drilling at well already in progress and affect 33 floater at work in the Gulf - be necessary , the administration say , to ensure the safety of other deepwater installation and give a governmentappointed commission time to determine what cause the 20 April explosion .  The six-month moratorium will lay waste to ten of thousand of job , not only in the deepwater industry itself , but also in the neighborhood and community of it workforce , the IADC say .  The American Petroleum Institute say the ban would result in a production loss of between 80,000b/d and 130,000b/d and idle some 50,000 worker in the Gulf , and urge the administration to reconsider the moratorium six-month duration .  The National Ocean Industries Association ( NOIA ) issue a similar statement , warn in early June that the deepwater ban be already have profound impact on the offshore energy industry , and these impact will only worsen the long the pause continue .  The group go on to list a sampling of it member , include small E & P company , moor specialist , communication provider , engineering company and equipment manufacturer that would suffer under the drilling ban .  Since the Gulf region depend on the offshore industry for thousand of job and billion of dollar in revenue , the impact of the `` one size fit all `` moratorium will add further job loss and economic woe to a region already suffer from these same hit to it seafood and tourism industry , NOIA say .

***** A New Orleans federal judge strike down President Obama 's six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , give the oil industry a temporary win in the fight to reopen 33 exploratory well project in the Gulf of Mexico .  As one analyst note in a Bloomberg report , `` you can have a non-moratorium moratorium .  The appeal process could drag out this out through the length of the intended moratorium .  The Interior Department could take the drastic step of cancel the deepwater lease altogether , but that would surely open the government up to a slew of lawsuit from the oil and gas industry .

The plaintiff consist of a group of company that make their money service gulf drilling operation ; they be lead by a shipping company , Hornbeck Offshore Services , which employ 1,300 and have spend nearly $ 700 million in the last five year build a new generation of ship for use in the gulf .  The secretary of the interior , Ken Salazar , have fail to take into account the enormous economic pain that would be inflict on the gulf region by such a moratorium , a he be require to under the law , Hornbeck argue .  The administration be punish deepwater drillers that have comply with all the regulation surround deepwater drill — and have get their permit fair and square .  Concluding that the decision to impose the moratorium be “ arbitrary and capricious , ” he write , “ An invalid agency decision to suspend drilling of well in depth of over 500 foot simply can not justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiff , the local economy , the gulf region , and the critical present-day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country .

HRT system by definition can not operate on normal street but require a grade-separated right-of-way .  Full grade separation bring significant time save benefit ( a all traffic congestion and intersection delay be eliminate ) , but also significantly increase construction cost and maintenance cost , regardless of whether the vehicle operate on elevate or underground structure be bus , heavy rail vehicle , or light-rail vehicle .  The cost of tunnel and elevate the HRT system be not only relate to tunnel or elevate the right-of-way .  Even costly be elevate or excavate for each station , which be likely to cost around US $ 100 million per station .  Most elevate or underground heavy rapid transit system minimize the number of station to increase speed and keep the cost down , but this frequently limit accessibility to the system .  Were station locate in optimal location , the cost of HRT alternative would be significantly increase .  LRT and BRT both have significantly low capital cost in relation to HRT primarily because they can be locate on normal city street .  In general , the most significant capital cost difference between an LRT and a BRT be due to the following .

On recess appointments.
***** In the United States , a recess appointment be an appointment by the president of a federal official when the U .  Senate be in recess .  Constitution 's Appointments Clause , the President be empower to nominate , and with the advice and consent ( confirmation ) of the Senate , make appointment to high-level policy-making position in federal department , agency , board , and commission , as well a to the federal judiciary .  A recess appointment under Article II , Section 2 , Clause 3 of the Constitution be an alternative method of appoint official that allow the temporary filling of office during period when the Senate be not in session .  It be anticipate that the Senate would be away for month at a time , so the ability to fill vacancy in important position when the Senate be in recess and unavailable to provide advice and consent be deem essential to maintain government function , a describe by Alexander Hamilton in No .  In modern time , the Senate be in session nearly year-round , make the recess appointment mechanism far less necessary or useful for upkeep of government function .  Nonetheless , in recent time this power have also be controversially use a a political tool to temporarily install an unpopular nominee by sidestep the Senate 's role in the confirmation process ; [ 1 ] the Senate have take measure from time to time to prevent a president from make recess appointment , specifically by hold pro forma session .  The Supreme Court affirm that pro forma session be sufficient to prevent recess appointment and address other intricacy of the practice in NLRB v .  During the last two year of the Bush administration , Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid seek to prevent further recess appointment .  The Senate or House may seek to block potential recess appointment by not allow the Senate to adjourn under Article 1 , Section 5 , Clause 4 of the Constitution , which provide that both Houses must consent to an adjournment .  [ 39 ] Justice Stephen Breyer , in the majority opinion , write that the Constitution allow for the Congress itself to determine it session and recess , that `` the Senate be in session when it say it be `` , and that the President do not have the unilateral right to dictate Congressional session and thus make recess appointment .

The Senate may recess both between and during it annual session , but the time period during which the President may make a recess appointment be not clearly answer by the text of the Constitution .

A discussion of the clause by Alexander Hamilton , in The Federalist Papers , suggest that it purpose be to provide an alternative method of appointment that would allow the filling of vacancy `` without delay `` during period of Senate absence .  2 This interpretation be support by the fact that both house of Congress have relatively short session and long recess during the country 's early year .  For example , recess appointment have sometimes enable the President to temporarily install an appointee who probably would not be confirm by the Senate .  Notwithstanding the legal opinion and practice of the precede decade , a Department of Justice legal opinion and two federal appeal court decision relate to four controversial recess appointment make by President Barack Obama on January 4 , 2012 , raise question about what a `` recess `` be with regard to the recess appointment power .  Alternatively , the President sometimes will use a recess appointment to fill a position while a different nominee to the same position be go through the Senate confirmation process .  There be , however , several provision of law that may prevent a recess appointee from be pay , and this could discourage the President from make a recess appointment under certain circumstance .

Rather , the President may also determine whether a recess be underway by as whether the Senate be available to participate in the advice and consent process .

***** Often a politically controversial move , the “ recess appointment ” be a method by which the President of the United States can legally appoint new senior federal official , like Cabinet secretary , without the constitutionally-required approval of the Senate .  The power to make recess appointment be grant to the president by Article II , Section , 2 , Clause 3 of the U .  Since early session of Congress last only three to six month , Senators would scatter throughout the country during the six-to-nine-month recess to take care of their farm or business .  Thus , the Framers intend that the Recess Appointments Clause would function a a “ supplement ” to the hotly debate presidential appointment power , and be necessary so that the Senate need not , a Alexander Hamilton write in The Federalist No .  67 , “ be continually in session for the appointment of officer .  ” Similar to the general appointment power provide in Article II , Section 2 , Clause 2 , of the Constitution , the recess appointment power applies to the appointment of “ Officers of the United States .  In the majority opinion , Justice Stephen Breyer hold that the Constitution allow Congress itself to determine it session and recess , write decisively that “ the Senate be in session when it say it be , ” and that the president do not have the authority to dictate session of Congress and thus make recess appointment .

However , the current practice of horizontal drill couple with multiple application of hydraulic fracturing in a single well be pioneer in the late 1980s and have continue to evolve .  Since the final year of the 20th century , the use of this technique to produce oil and gas from previously unproductive formation have dramatically increase , which have push hydraulic fracturing and related process into region where oil and gas have not previously be produce .  Hydraulic fracture be use in many establish oil and gas produce region of the country as well a some area new to the petroleum industry .  Who be responsible for monitor the issue associate with hydraulic fracturing and protect our environment ? .  Individual state regulate many aspect of oil and gas exploration and production .  Hydraulic fracturing , informally refer to a “ fracking , ” be an oil and gas well development process that typically involve inject water , sand , and chemical under high pressure into a bedrock formation via the well .
***** Hydraulic fracturing , or “ fracking , ” be revolutionize oil and gas drilling across the country .  Fracking be do by drill deep into the earth , then use small explosion and a mix of water , sand , and chemical to break up shale rock formation that contain natural gas and oil .
***** Journal of Material Sciences View PDF Download PDF Abstract Hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , be a technique use to excavate natural gas and oil trap within porous layer of shale thousand of foot below the surface .  There be clear challenge which must be overcome , however , to fairly address public concern over the amount of toxic chemical use and the potential danger pose to drink water resource .  Technology Hydraulic fracture be not a new process - it have be around since the late 1940s .  One major reason why we have see a surge in shale gas harvesting within the last decade be due to the addition of horizontal drilling technique ( 1998 ) and highly effective , though controversial , fracking fluid .  During the vertical drilling , the hole above and around the bit be fill and circulate with drill mud-an aqueous slurry of additive use to help lubricate and cool the drill bit , make drilling faster and easy .  After a significant portion have be drill , the case be low into place use a guide shoe .  The motivation behind horizontal drill lie with the fact that the shale be usually much more expansive in the horizontal direction , rather than the vertical ; i .  Therefore , by directional , or horizontal drilling , much more of the rock can be access to extract the natural gas .  The hole be guide via use of a steerable motor , orient the cutting over a gradual bend radius until the desired horizontal direction be achieve .  Fracturing Process Once the horizontal section have be drill and case , the fracture process can begin .

***** CONCLUSIONSdisclosure statementacknowledgmentsliterature cite Abstract Unconventional oil and natural gas extraction enable by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing ( fracking ) be drive an economic boom , with consequence describe from “ revolutionary ” to “ disastrous .  Unconventional energy generates income and , do well , can reduce air pollution and even water use compare with other fossil fuel .  Keywords horizontal drilling , hydraulic fracturing , induced seismicity , shale gas , water resource , air quality , well integrity1 .  These rock be long know to contain hydrocarbon and to have serve a source rock for many conventional oil and gas field .  Recent advancement in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have change that view ( 1 , 2 ) .  Drilling be now do kilometer underground and to horizontal distance of 2 km or more , track shale , sandstone , and other formation a narrow a 30 m thick .  After horizontal drilling , the well be hydraulically fracture .  The fracture induce by high-pressure , high-volume hydraulic fracturing provide the conductivity necessary to allow natural gas and oil to flow from the formation to the well and then up through the well to the surface .  Natural gas use in power generation be expect to grow by 60 % in the United States over the next quarter century , largely at the expense of coal ( 8 ) , although coal production be still project to increase globally during that time ( 8 ) .
***** The Process and The Risks The gas industry be steadfast in it claim that hydraulic fracturing and associate drilling practice be safe and pose no threat to human and environmental health .  Much like offshore drilling , gas operation occur in a regulatory void , have outpace federal and state oversight .  Traditional hydraulic fracturing be a process that have be employ by the gas industry since the 1940s , a favorite talk point among fracking defender .  Hydraulic fracture have long be use to access conventional oil and gas deposit .  Gas extraction undergo a significant technological transformation in the 1990s , when operator begin use a technique develop for oil extraction .  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] With the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling into a new technique know a High Volume Slickwater Hydraulic Fracturing , the overall scope of gas extraction have transform , call for unprecedented amount of water , chemical additive and drilling pressure .  ” [ 4 ] Although industry like to characterize the process a successfully prove for over six decade “ what they fail to say be that they ’ ve have few than 10 year of experience on a large scale use these unconventional method to develop gas from shale , ” [ 5 ] Ingraffea say .  The difficulty of access large amount of unconventional gas by drill lone vertical well lead to the expansion of production procedure .
***** How Hydraulic Fracturing Works See how hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , release petroleum or natural gas trap in shale rock formation .  Hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , be a drilling method use to extract petroleum ( oil ) or natural gas from deep in the Earth .  By access tight oil and tight gas , the sophisticated technology use in fracking be rapidly expand petroleum and natural gas production in the United States .  This video explain the technology of fracking use the example of the Iverson oil well , which drill into the Bakken shale formation near Williston , North Dakota .  A handful of other nation be invest in hydraulic fracturing to extract petroleum and natural gas .
***** Energy term Hydraulic fracturing , also know a fracking , be a method of oil and natural gas extraction .  3 Injection well 7 News item 8 See also 9 Footnotes See also .  Fracking Well field in Odessa , Texas Hydraulic fracturing , also know a fracking , be a method of oil and natural gas extraction .  5 percent and 2 percent of the fluid be compose of chemical additive , which be use to stop the growth of microorganism , prevent well case corrosion , increase the rate at which the fluid be inject , and reduce pressure , among other thing .  natural gas production from 2000 to 2015 `` be mainly the result of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technique , notably in shale , sandstone , carbonate , and other tight geologic formation .  Fracturing be use experimentally in Kansas in 1947 to extract natural gas from limestone .  Beginning in 1949 , this experimental technology be use commercially by Halliburton , an oilfield service company .  , invest between $ 7 million and $ 8 million to research and develop fracking and horizontal drilling and to extract natural gas in the Barnett Shale of Texas .  Between 2000 and 2010 , company begin use different type of frack fluid and additive during the fracking process to enhance oil and gas recovery .  From 2007 to 2009 , fracking spur by new treatment fluid and additive lead to increase shale gas production in state outside Texas , such a Pennsylvania , Ohio , West Virginia , and North Dakota .

When the hydraulic pressure be remove from the well , small grain of hydraulic fracturing proppants ( either sand or aluminium oxide ) hold the fracture open .  6 Drilling and hydraulic fracturing have make the United States a major crude oil exporter a of 2019,7 but leakage of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , have dramatically increase .  22 There be considerable uncertainty about the scale of methane leakage associate with hydraulic fracturing , and even some evidence that leakage may cancel out the greenhouse gas emission benefit of natural gas relative to other fossil fuel .  23 This leakage rate be consider representative of the hydraulic fracturing industry in the US generally .  272829 The European Union be draft regulation that would permit the controlled application of hydraulic fracturing .  4 Massive fracturing 2 .  Fracture ( geology ) Halliburton fracture operation in the Bakken Formation , North Dakota , United States A fracturing operation in progress Mechanics [ edit ] Fracturing rock at great depth frequently become suppress by pressure due to the weight of the overlie rock stratum and the cementation of the formation .  3132 Fractures form in this way be generally orient in a plane perpendicular to the minimum principal stress , and for this reason , hydraulic fracture in well bore can be use to determine the orientation of stress .  33 In natural example , such a dike or vein-filled fracture , the orientation can be use to infer past state of stress .
On offshore drilling.
***** When offshore platform be no longer active they be decommission , which usually require the removal of the entire platform from the marine environment , destroy the artificial reef that have be create and potentially result in the loss of important ecosystem service .  The presence of offshore platform and the associate marine life alters the ecosystem from that which exist prior to the installation of the platform , and there may be factor which make restoration of the ecosystem unfeasible or even detrimental to the environment .  With thousand of platform to be decommission around the world in come decade , the novel ecosystem concept provide a mechanism for recognize the ecological role play by offshore platform .  Introduction Since 1947 , when Ship Shoal Block 32 in the Gulf of Mexico become the world first offshore oil drilling platform ( Aagard and Besse , 1973 ) , the offshore energy industry expand rapidly to currently number over 12,000 offshore installation globally ( Ars and Rios , 2017 ) .  Offshore platform be situate on the continental shelf of 53 country , make offshore oil and gas production a major global industry ( Parente et al .  offshore platform be now large and find in deep water , far from shore .  A 2016 study by the IHS Markit forecast the global decommissioning of over 600 offshore structure between 2017 and 2021 , with a further 2,000 project by 2040 , result in a total cost between 2010 and 2040 of US 210 billion ( IHS Markit , 2016 ) .  From a biological viewpoint , increase evidence suggest that offshore oil and gas platform provide significant ecosystem service while active .  The potential ecological value of offshore platform raise the question of whether there may be alternative to the standard decommissioning process that might have important positive ecological outcome , and ecological factor be more recently be include in decommission assessment ( Fowler et al .
***** Discussions about offshore v .  onshore drilling be about the kind of equipment use in each of them .  Onshore drilling in the region have go up over the last 20 year .  It involve drive a drilling rig deep into the earth to reach fossil fuel while an offshore drilling rig drill underneath the seabed .  onshore drilling , you need to invest in blowout preventers to protect worker at the drill site from potential risk .
***** When the land reserve be get empty up due to the constant scooping and drilling , the ever increase demand for oil and gas have to be extend to the resource-rich ocean .  Offshore drilling and platform development have cater billion of tonne of natural resource to the global market over time .  Subsea drilling and the related work be consider operationally challenge and financially tax .  Locating the offshore oil and gas reservoir and use of MODU To decide on a site with a potential oil/gas payout , Geologists and Geo-Scientists work their way in and around the information collect off the area with possible oil or gas reservoir .  Types of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units Or MODU Mobile offshore drill unit ( MODU ) be classify into a number of structure , namely .
***** On day one he rejoin the Paris Agreement , and now he have announce a pause on offshore oil and gas leasing .  But President Biden have commit to aggressively address the climate crisis , which give me great hope that we can work together to permanently protect our climate and coast from offshore oil and gas .  Permanently end new offshore oil and gas leasing in U .  A new report from Oceana estimate that permanent protection against offshore drilling would prevent 19 billion ton of greenhouse gas emission and $ 720 billion in damage to people , property and the environment .  Damage that result from offshore drilling In addition to the climate impact , offshore drilling also lead to oil spill .

While offshore drillers have deliver value for brief period , they have destroy value in excess of $ 85 billion since the 2007 peak , through speculative rig investment and a lack of commercial discipline ( Exhibit 1 ) .  Leaders in offshore drilling have respond to the downturn by incrementally reduce cost , delay capital expenditure , and cancel order for new rig .  many offshore drillers be approach bankruptcy , their operating cash flow unable to support debt-ridden balance sheet or the traditional industry business model .
***** CBF President Will Baker address a crowd during a protest of offshore drilling .  In particular , the danger pose by offshore drilling be unacceptable .  Potential offshore drill location include the ocean water off the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay .  Offshore drilling use huge fix or float platform to extract oil and natural gas reserve from beneath the ocean .  For four decade , the Chesapeake Bay Foundation have take a stand against any expansion of the oil and gas industry in the Bay watershed , include offshore drilling .
***** In April 2019 , it be report that the Interior Department 's plan to ramp up offshore oil and gas leasing have be sideline indefinitely , a result of a federal court ruling that same month , which reinstate the Obama-era ban on offshore drilling that protect nearly 128 million acre in the Arctic and Atlantic ocean combine .  And the Atlantic coast be heavily dependent on tourism and recreation , which be simply incompatible with offshore drilling and the risk it bring .  Investing in offshore drilling be not only destructive—it ’ s nonsense .  Trump ( Offshore Leasing Ban ) Our broad coalition be fight the Trump administration to keep our coast permanently off-limits to oil and gas drilling .
***** ( ESSO ) to construct the first offshore oil and gas drilling and production facility off the Ivory Coast .
***** Offshore Drilling Drilling for natural gas offshore , in some instance hundred of mile away from the near landmass , pose a number of different challenge over drilling onshore .  The actual drilling mechanism use to delve into the sea floor be much the same a can be find on an onshore rig .  However , with drilling at sea , the sea floor can sometimes be thousand of foot below sea level .  Therefore , while with onshore drill the ground provide a platform from which to drill , at sea an artificial drilling platform must be construct .  Drilling offshore date back a early a 1869 , when one of the first patent be grant to T .  Rowland for his offshore drilling rig design .  This rig be design to operate in very shallow water , but the anchored four legged tower bear much resemblance to modern offshore rig .
***** Offshore drilling have dig itself a deep hole since Deepwater Horizon Ten year after Deepwater Horizon , offshore drill creep far away from shore Share All share option for .  Offshore drilling have dig itself a deep hole since Deepwater Horizon Ever since the first oil well be build in the Gulf of Mexico in 14 foot of water in 1938 , technology advancement make it easy to move far away from shore in pursuit of new oil reserve , at time without a plan for worst-case scenario .  Since then , offshore drilling operation continue to creep farther out into ultra-deep water — where depth reach 1,500 meter ( about 5,000 foot ) or more .  Sustaining that output will require even more exploration , drilling , and development in deep water , Tyler Priest , an oil and energy historian at the University of Iowa , tell The Verge .  She and Boesch point to the Trump administration ’ s effort to simultaneously ramp up US fossil fuel production , include a bid to open up more shore to offshore drilling that ’ s currently tie up in court , while roll back environmental protection .
***** Here , we review the type of activity that be associate with global offshore oil and gas development in water depth over 200 m , the typical impact of these activity , some of the more extreme impact of accidental oil and gas release , and the current state of management in the major region of offshore industrial activity include 18 exclusive economic zone .  Discharges of water-based and low-toxicity oil-based drilling mud and produced water can extend over 2 km , while the ecological impact at the population and community level on the seafloor be most commonly on the order of 200300 m from their source .  This synthesis of information provide the basis for a series of recommendation for the management of offshore oil and gas development .  Potentially petroliferous offshore zone and regional distribution of proven offshore oil and gas reserve .  Here , we seek to synthesize current information on typical impact from offshore oil and gas operation and review exist management strategy and regulation in order to provide the basis for a set of recommendation for a generalized management strategy to limit environmental impact attributable to the deep-water ( 200 m ) oil and gas industry .  By the 1960s , this drilling have move into deep offshore area a easily accessible resource decline , technology for offshore drill improve , and large reserve of hydrocarbon be discover .  Currently , drill for oil and gas be routine in all offshore environment , with major deep-water ( 200 m ) production in area such a the Arctic , northern North Atlantic Ocean ( UK and Norwegian water ) , East and West Africa , Gulf of Mexico , South America , India , Southeast Asia , and Australia ( Figure 1 ) .  This typically involve the drilling of one or more appraisal well follow by several production well and the installation of various surface ( e .  Additional drilling may be require a the field develop , either to expand the field or to enhance oil or gas recovery ( Boesch and Rabalais , 1987 ) .

***** The funding of public elementary and secondary school in the United States involve a combination of local , state , and federal government revenue , in proportion that vary substantially both across and within state .  According to the most recent data , state government provide 47 .  0 % of these revenue , local government provide 44 .  8 % , and the federal government provide 8 .  Over the last several decade , the share of public elementary and secondary education revenue provide by state government have increase , the share provide by local government have decrease , and the federal share have vary within a range of 6 .  The primary source of local revenue for public elementary and secondary education be the property tax , while state revenue be raise from a variety of source , primarily personal and corporate income and retail sale tax , a variety of “ excise ” tax such a those on tobacco product and alcoholic beverage , and lottery in several state .  All state ( but not the District of Columbia ) provide a share of the total revenue available for public elementary and secondary education .  This state share varies widely , from approximately 25 % in Illinois to almost 90 % in Hawaii and Vermont .  The program through which state fund be provide to local educational agency ( LEAs ) for public elementary and secondary education have traditionally be categorize into five type .  Of these , Foundation Programs be most common , although many state use a combination of program type .
