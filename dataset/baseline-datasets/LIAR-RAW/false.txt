The Iraq Study Group reported that (Saddam Hussein) had designs on reviving his nuclear program.

Contrary to prewar statement by President Bush and top administration official , Saddam do not have chemical and biological stockpile when the war begin and his nuclear capability be deteriorate , not advance , say Charles Duelfer , head of the Iraq Survey Group .  Interviews with the toppled leader and other former Iraqi official make it clear that Saddam have not lose his ambition to pursue weapon of mass destruction and hop to revive his weapon program if U .  sanction be lift , his report say .  Duelfer ’ s find , include in a report that run more than 1,000 page , come less than four week before an election in which Bush ’ s handle of Iraq have become the central issue .
***** In his oral evidence to u , Dr Inch tell u that he be `` totally confused `` by report that Iraq still have large quantity of such weapon .  they have set up special group to search for and secure such weapon .

[ 251 ] The executive summary declare that the judgement make in the report `` reflect [ ed ] the view of the Joint Intelligence Committee ( JIC ) .

***** Biographical Information for Commissioners and List of Commission Staff On the brink of war , and in front of the whole world , the United States government assert that Saddam Hussein have reconstitute his nuclear weapon program , have biological weapon and mobile biological weapon production facility , and have stockpile and be produce chemical weapon .  Across the board , the Intelligence Community know disturbingly little about the nuclear program of many of the world 's most dangerous actor .  For almost 50 year after the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 , the Intelligence Community 's resource be overwhelmingly train on a single threat -- the Soviet Union , it nuclear arsenal , it massive conventional force , and it activity around the world .  We can imagine no threat that demand great strategic focus from the Intelligence Community than that pose by nuclear , biological , and chemical weapon .  This Overview -- and , in far more detail , the report that follow -- offer our conclusion on what need to be do .  We begin by describe the result of our case study -- which include Iraq , Libya , Afghanistan , and others -- and the lesson they teach about the Intelligence Community 's current capability and weakness .  This be a task that often lend itself to hubris and to second-guessing , and we have be humble by the difficult judgment that have to be make about Iraq and it weapon program .  Accordingly , while we interview a host of current and former policymakers during the course of our investigation , the purpose of those interview be to learn about how the Intelligence Community reach and communicate it judgment about Iraq 's weapon program -- not to review how policymakers subsequently use that information .  Our first task be to evaluate the Intelligence Community 's performance in as the nuclear , biological , and chemical weapon activity of three country .  We want a range of study so we would not judge the Intelligence Community solely on it handle of Iraq , which be -- however important -- a single intelligence target .  The October 2002 NIE contain an extensive technical analysis of Iraq 's suspected weapon program but little serious analysis of the socio-political situation in Iraq , or the motif and intention of Iraqi leadership -- which , in a dictatorship like Iraq , really meant understand Saddam .

These revelation about Iraq 's program result from inspection right grant by the United Nations Security Council to the UN Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) and the International Atomic Energy Agency Action Team .  2 Under this mandate , inspector systemically uncovered large portion of Iraq 's nuclear weapon program , include an enrichment program that be expect to produce large amount of HEU by the mid-1990s .  3 The IAEA 's major find be present in a series of report available from the United Nations .  Jaffer Dhia Jaffer , the head of the nuclear weapon program during the 1980s , tell inspector that Iraq do not plan to conduct a test before it have accumulate a few nuclear weapon .  Because Iraq 's nuclear weapon program before the Persian Gulf War be so vast , it could probably produce fissile material and build a nuclear weapon considerably faster than many other develop state .

***** 35 EDTSaddam Hussein destroy his last weapon of mass destruction more than a decade ago and his capacity to build new one have be dwindle for year by the time of the Iraq invasion , accord to a comprehensive US report release yesterday .  The report , the culmination of an intensive 15-month search by 1,200 inspector from the CIA 's Iraq Survey Group ( ISG ) , conclude that Saddam have ambition to restart at least chemical and nuclear programme once sanction be lift .  However , Charles Duelfer , the head of the ISG and the report 's chief author , say that by late 2001 , when the international embargo on Iraq be tighten , it be clear sanction would not have contain Saddam for much long .  He point out the report be comprehensive but `` not final `` a a team of 900 linguist be still sift through a mountain of document .  `` Tony Blair say that the report show Saddam be seek to develop weapon of mass destruction and have retain key scientist to do so .
***** More than a decade after Saddam Hussein agree to give up weapon of mass destruction , Iraq have step up it quest for nuclear weapon and have embark on a worldwide hunt for material to make an atomic bomb , Bush administration official say today .  The diameter , thickness and other technical specification of the aluminum tube have persuade American intelligence expert that they be mean for Iraqs nuclear program , official say , and that the late attempt to ship the material have take place in recent month .  The attempt purchase be not the only sign of a renew Iraqi interest in acquire nuclear arm .  President Hussein have meet repeatedly in recent month with Iraqs top nuclear scientist and , accord to American intelligence , praise their effort a part of his campaign against the West .  Iraqi defector who once work for the nuclear weapon establishment have tell American official that acquire nuclear arm be again a top Iraqi priority .  American intelligence agency be also monitor construction at nuclear site .  While there be no indication that Iraq be on the verge of deploy a nuclear bomb , Iraqs pursuit of nuclear weapon have be cite by hard-liners in the Bush administration to make the argument that the United States must act now , before Mr .  Hussein acquire nuclear arm and thus alter the strategic balance in the oil-rich Persian Gulf .  Iraqs nuclear program be not Washingtons only concern .  Much of the administration case , however , revolve around Iraqs attempt to develop nuclear weapon and assessment of the pace of the effort .  On the Brink of WarHard-liners be alarm that American intelligence underestimate the pace and scale of Iraqs nuclear program before Baghdads defeat in the gulf war .  Husseins dog insistence on pursue his nuclear ambition , along with what defector describe in interview a Iraqs push to improve and expand Baghdads chemical and biological arsenal , have bring Iraq and the United States to the brink of war .  An intelligence report date to October 1990 , just after Iraqs invasion of Kuwait , reflect American concern that Iraq might have master the production of dusty VX , despite the fact that there be no evidence it have do so , accord to an intelligence report write in October 1990 .

None be know to have go to Tehran , which Washington believe be try to build a nuclear weapon .  Obeidi , who meet Hussein three time , say there be “ no question ” that the former Iraqi president want to revive his illicit weapon program , but add that it wasn ’ t clear whether the dictator know his regime have no active program to build them .
***** A further term of the text invite the Iraqi Government to report to the Council within one year on progress make in adhere to all applicable disarmament and non-proliferation treaty and related international agreement , notably the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons ( Chemical Weapons Convention ) and the Additional Protocol to it Safeguards Agreement .  After extensive inspection in early 2003 , the Agency have report that it do not find evidence of the resumption of such weapon programme in Iraq , though many disarmament issue remain unresolved .  Gustavo Zlauvinen , speak on behalf of the Director General of the IAEA , recall his 7 March 2003 report , in which he have inform the Council that the Agency have find no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapon programme in Iraq .  He hop that , in the near future , once the security situation permit , the Agency would be able to provide assurance of the non-diversion of declared nuclear material and the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activity in the country .  France be prepare to support the text and would call on the Government of Iraq to report to the Council in one year on those concern .  The Security Council , Recalling it previous relevant resolution , include resolution 661 ( 1990 ) of 6 August 1990 , 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 , 699 ( 1991 ) of 17 June 1991 , 707 ( 1991 ) of 15 August 1991 , 715 ( 1991 ) of 11 October 1991 , 1051 ( 1996 ) of 27 March 1996 , 1284 ( 1999 ) of 17 December 1999 , 1441 ( 2002 ) of 8 November 2002 , 1483 ( 2003 ) of 22 May 2003 , 1540 ( 2004 ) of 28 April 2004 and 1546 ( 2004 ) of 8 June 2004 , Expressing gratitude to the United Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission ( UNMOVIC ) and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) for their important and comprehensive contribution under the relevant resolution , note the accumulation of expertise , experience and maintenance of a roster of expert during UNMOVICs mandate , and encouraging Member States to maintain similar expertise for the future , Acknowledging that a democratically elect and constitutionally base Government of Iraq be now in place , note the Government of Iraqs declaration of  Since 2003 , evidence have be find of Saddam Hussein regimes nuclear effort before 1991 , but no evidence have be find that a serious attempt have be make to revive those programme since then .
***** Bush raise the specter of the Iraqi pursuit of nuclear weapon a one justification for take decisive action against Iraq .  coalition be able to compel Iraq to agree to an inspection and monitoring regime , intend to insure that Iraq dismantle it WMD program and do not take action to reconstitute them .  make it clear that it would not accept what have become the status quo with respect to Iraq - a country rule by Saddam Hussein and free to attempt to reconstitute it assorted weapon of mass destruction program .  and Britain publish document and provide brief detail their conclusion concern Iraq 's WMD program and it attempt to deceive other nation about those program .  On December 7 , 2002 , Iraq submit it 12,000 page declaration , which claim that it have no current WMD program .  force move through Iraq , there be initial report that chemical or biological weapon might have be uncover , but close examination produce negative result .  In May 2003 , the Bush administration decide to establish a specialized group of about 1,500 individual , the Iraq Survey Group ( ISG ) , to search the country for WMD - replace the 75th Exploitation Task Force , which have originally be assign the mission .  ( and British ) intelligence in collect and evaluate information about Iraqi weapon of mass destruction program .  and British assessment of Iraq 's WMD program ; the IAEA and UNSCOM report cover the final period prior to their 1998 departure , and between November 27 , 2002 , and February 2003 ; the transcript of a key speech by President Bush ; a statement of U .  Much that be of interest concern intelligence and Iraqi weapon of mass destruction have appear in article , monograph , and study publish by magazine or research group .  The State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence Research ( INR ) argue that while Saddam wish to acquire a nuclear weapon , it do not believe that Iraq 's recent activity make a compelling case that a comprehensive attempt to acquire nuclear weapon be be make .  While in his cover letter ElBaradei observe that `` we have to date find no evidence that Iraq have revive it nuclear weapon programme since the elimination of the programme in the 1990s , `` in the update report it be also note that `` little progress have be make in resolve the question and concern that remain a of 1998 `` and that `` further verification activity will be necessary before the IAEA will be able to provide credible assurance that Iraq have no nuclear weapon programme .
***** Book Description This book be an authoritative account of the nuclear weapon inspection regime in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 .  In the 1990s , after adapt to a completely new kind of intrusive inspection with unprecedented access right , the IAEA discover and dismantle Iraq ’ s clandestine nuclear weapon program and put in place an efficient monitoring system which could have contain Saddam Hussein ’ s attempt to reconstitute his nuclear program .  Based on various source include inspection report and other document in the archive of the IAEA Iraq Action Team at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna , Dismantling the Iraqi Nuclear Programme present completely new information about the weapon inspection regime in Iraq and offer valuable lesson for future non-proliferation and disarmament case .
***** -led coalition force invade Iraq this past March that Iraq “ have reconstitute nuclear weapon .  The international community discover after Iraq ’ s defeat in the 1991 Persian Gulf War that Iraq have a much more advanced nuclear weapon program than either the United States or the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) have suspect .  The agency , however , report in 1999 that , base on the inspector ’ work until that time , there be “ no indication that Iraq posse nuclear weapon or any meaningful amount of weapon-usable nuclear material , or that Iraq have retain any practical capability ( facility or hardware ) for the production of such material .  ’ ” A 2001 Department of Defense report add that Iraq “ still retain sufficient skilled and experienced scientist and engineer as well a weapon design information that could allow it to restart a weapon program .  ” The absence of inspector , combine with the remain uncertainty regard Iraq ’ s nuclear program , create concern that Iraq be reconstitute it nuclear weapon program .

Inspection Activities When I report last to the Council , on 14 February , I explain that the Agency 's inspection activity have move well beyond the `` reconnaissance phase `` - that be , re-establishing our knowledge base regard Iraq 's nuclear capability - into the `` investigative phase `` , which focus on the central question before the IAEA relevant to disarmament .  whether Iraq have revive or attempt to revive it defunct nuclear weapon programme over the last four year .  This overall deterioration in industrial capacity be naturally of direct relevance to Iraq 's capability for resume a nuclear weapon programme .  After three month of intrusive inspection , we have to date find no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapon programme in Iraq .
***** Biographical Information for Commissioners and List of Commission Staff INTRODUCTION On the brink of war , and in front of the whole world , the United States government assert that Saddam Hussein have reconstitute his nuclear weapon program , have biological weapon and mobile biological weapon production facility , and have stockpile and be produce chemical weapon .  Across the board , the Intelligence Community know disturbingly little about the nuclear program of many of the world most dangerous actor .  For almost 50 year after the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 , the Intelligence Communitys resource be overwhelmingly train on a single threatthe Soviet Union , it nuclear arsenal , it massive conventional force , and it activity around the world .  We can imagine no threat that demand great strategic focus from the Intelligence Community than that pose by nuclear , biological , and chemical weapon .  This Overviewand , in far more detail , the report that followsoffers our conclusion on what need to be do .  This be a task that often lend itself to hubris and to second-guessing , and we have be humble by the difficult judgment that have to be make about Iraq and it weapon program .  CASE STUDIES IN FAILURE AND SUCCESS Our first task be to evaluate the Intelligence Communitys performance in as the nuclear , biological , and chemical weapon activity of three country .  We want a range of study so we would not judge the Intelligence Community solely on it handle of Iraq , which washowever importanta single intelligence target .  An Overview In October 2002 , at the request of member of Congress , the National Intelligence Council produce a National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) the most authoritative intelligence assessment produce by the Intelligence Communitywhich conclude that Iraq be reconstitute it nuclear weapon program and be actively pursue a nuclear device .  But , after ten year of effort , the Intelligence Community still have no good intelligence on the status of Iraqs weapon program .

***** One such thing be allegation that the dramatic extent of global warm be not due to man but due solely to natural cause .  Thankfully , here be a neat graphic from the late report of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change ( IPCC ) which should convince all those who can be convince that man be contribute a whole lot to global warming .  The graphic show nine simplify graph , which essentially illustrate how actual temperature change from roughly the past 100 year relate to scientific prediction of temperature change in scenario where man be not contribute to global warming and where man be indeed contribute to global warming .  These change correlate very well with prediction where man contribute to global warming .

Why scientist think 100 % of global warming be due to human Zeke Hausfather13 .  While human factor explain all the long-term warming , there be some specific period that appear to have warm or cool fast than can be explain base on our best estimate of radiative forcing .
***** The most recent special report on global warming of 1 .  5 degree confirms that the observed change in global and regional climate over the last 50 or so year be almost entirely due to human influence on the climate system and not due to natural cause .  For example , every 11 year or so , the Sun ’ s magnetic field completely flips and this can cause small fluctuation in global temperature , up to about 0 .
***** Scientists have document that anthropogenic source of greenhouse gas be lead to a buildup in the atmosphere , which lead to a general warming of the global climate and an alteration in the statistical distribution of localized weather pattern over long period of time .  Physical scientist may set the parameter for understand the technical aspect of the climate debate , but they do not have the final word on whether society accepts or even understand their conclusion .  1 The percentage of conservative and Republicans who believe that the effect of global warm have already begin decline from roughly 50 percent in 2001 to about 30 percent in 2010 , while the corresponding percentage for liberal and Democrats increase from roughly 60 percent in 2001 to about 70 percent in 2010 .  I take this approach not because the physical science have become less relevant , but because we need to understand the social and psychological process by which people receive and understand the science of global warming .  But to understand and accept this , we need to conceive of the global ecosystem in a new way .  For example , one study have show that Republicans be less likely to think that the phenomenon be real when it be refer to a “ global warming ” ( 44 percent ) rather than “ climate change ” ( 60 percent ) , but Democrats be unaffected by the term ( 87 percent v .
***** The current survey examine the literature publish from 2012 to November 2020 to explore whether the consensus have change .
***** However , since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s , the global temperature have increase at a much faster rate .  Without greenhouse gas and their warming effect , we would n't be able to survive .  In an 'El Niño ' year , the global temperature warm up , and in a 'La Niña ' year , it cool down .
***** Some gas in the Earth 's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse , trap the sun 's heat and stop it from leak back into space and cause global warming .  carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) methanenitrous oxidefluorinated gasesCO2 produce by human activity be the large contributor to global warming .
***** Learn more about Science & Democracy Scientists agree that global warming be cause mainly by human activity .  They include rise level of carbon dioxide , unprecedented warming , and a distinct atomic signature leave behind in the atmosphere when fossil fuel be burn .  Rising carbon dioxide level Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) be the heat-trapping gas in our atmosphere responsible for most of the warming measure over the past several decade .  Unprecedented warming As the concentration of CO2 and other heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere rise , the Earth warm up .  In fact , Earth have recently undergo unprecedented warming , particularly since the 1950s .
***** Is climate change a part of the planet ’ s natural warming and cool cycle ? .  How do we know global warm be not because of the sun or volcano ? .  For more than a century , scientist have understand the basic physic behind why greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide cause warming .  Average global temperature have increase by 2 .  By 1991 , two-thirds of earth and atmospheric scientist survey for an early consensus study say that they accept the idea of anthropogenic global warming .  And by 1995 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a famously conservative body that periodically take stock of the state of scientific knowledge , conclude that “ the balance of evidence suggest that there be a discernible human influence on global climate .  “ Should the public come to believe that the scientific issue be settle , their view about global warming will change accordingly , ” he write .  But these be just the result of natural climate variability or other human activity that temporarily counteract greenhouse warming .  That ’ s why “ global warming ” be a bit of an oversimplification .
***** The division start with view about the cause of global climate change .  Beliefs about global climate change remain fairly stable Roughly half of adult ( 48 % ) say climate change be mostly due to human activity ; roughly three-in-ten say it be due to natural cause ( 31 % ) and another fifth say there be no solid evidence of warm ( 20 % ) .  There be a broad public expectation that climate change will have negative effect on animal and plant life , shoreline and weather pattern Large majority of Americans think global warming will lead to an array of negative effect for the Earth ’ s ecosystem .  1 Americans who believe global climate change be the result of human activity be far more likely than other Americans ( those who believe climate change result from natural pattern or that there be no evidence of global warming ) to say each of these effect be very likely .  The Pew Research Center survey explore people ’ s view about whether each of several policy and individual action can be effective at address climate change .  Just 9 % say climate scientist should have no role in policy issue regard global climate change .  Minority of public see consensus among climate scientist over cause of global warming Scientists first note the possibility that the burning of greenhouse gas , such a fossil fuel , could increase temperature back in the 1800s .
***** But the rapid warming we ’ re seeing now ca n't be explain by natural cycle of warm and cool .  This be the warming of Earth ’ s average temperature a a result of human activity , such a burn coal , oil and gas to produce energy to fuel our home and transport and cut down tree to produce the food we eat .  It 's part of the natural global ecosystem .  Global warming be n't real a it 's still cold Global warming be cause the Earth ’ s average surface temperature to increase .
***** Earth-orbiting satellite and other technological advance have enable scientist to see the big picture , collect many different type of information about our planet and it climate on a global scale .  This ancient , or paleoclimate , evidence reveals that current warm be occur roughly ten time faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming .  5 An indicator of current global average temperature a measure by NASA ; update annually .  The ocean have absorb much of this increase heat , with the top 100 meter ( about 328 foot ) of ocean show warming of more than 0 .
***** According to NASA , 2016 and 2020 be tie for the warm year since 1880 , continue a long-term trend of rise global temperature .  ( 2016-2019 ) 4 `` Based on extensive scientific evidence , it be extremely likely that human activity , especially emission of greenhouse gas , be the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century .  support the finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth be undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contribution be significant .  The IPCC ( 2013 ) , USGCRP ( 2017 ) , and USGCRP ( 2018 ) indicate that it be extremely likely that human influence have be the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-twentieth century .
***** In this diagram of the global carbon cycle , number on arrow represent carbon flow average over 2004 .  Over the last two century , the growth of fossilfuel combustion have be closely couple to global growth in energy use and economic activity .  Most of the observed recent global warm result from human activity Climatic warming or cool arises from change in the flow of energy through the climate system ( Figure 1 .  Do change in the Sun contribute to global warming ? .  This be both an important test of the climate model against observation and also a demonstration that recent observe global warming result largely from human rather than natural influence on climate .
***** OSLO ( Reuters ) - Evidence for man-made global warming have reach a “ gold standard ” level of certainty , add pressure for cut in greenhouse gas to limit rise temperature , scientist say on Monday .  They say confidence that human activity be raise the heat at the Earth ’ s surface have reach a “ five-sigma ” level , a statistical gauge meaning there be only a one-in-a-million chance that the signal would appear if there be no warming .
***** But the warming weve see over the past few decade be too rapid to be link to change in Earths orbit and too large to be cause by solar activity .

***** Scientists have no doubt that human be cause global warming .
***** We update previous effort to quantify the scientific consensus on climate change by search the recent literature for paper sceptical of anthropogenic-caused global warming .  We identify four sceptical paper out of the sub-set of 3000 , a evidence by abstract that be rat a implicitly or explicitly sceptical of human-caused global warming .  If there remain substantial genuine scientific doubt about whether modern climate change be human-caused , then the case for mitigation of greenhouse gas emission be weaken .  The question of the cause of observed and predict global warming and precipitation change be still highly politically salient .  A Gallup poll publish in April 2021 find that there have be a deepening of the partisan divide in American politics on whether observed increase in the planet 's temperature since the Industrial Revolution be primarily cause by human [ 1 ] .  anywhere from a major portion to all of the warming of the 20th century could plausibly result from natural cause accord to these result ' ( 6 ) Explicit rejection without quantificationExplicitly minimize or reject that human be cause global warming ' .  ConclusionOur result confirm , a have be find in numerous other previous study of this question , that there be no significant scientific debate among expert about whether or not climate change be human-caused .

***** Some people argue that global warming ( or , more accurately , global climate change ) be simply a result of cyclical climate change that take place naturally throughout time .
***** Summary When part of western Germany , Belgium and Netherlands have just experience catastrophic flood and the Pacific northwest have recently break heat record , it be counter-intuitive to challenge the prevailing pessimism about global warming .  capture for example by the Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf who say , “ Given this signal failure [ to vaccinate against Covid in line with the global interest ] , it be impossible to imagine we will do much more than fiddle while the planet burn .  Every sensible person agree that ( 1 ) global warming have be happen over most of the second half of the twentieth century and on into the twenty first , and ( 2 ) most of it to date be due to greenhouse gas emission .  ( 3 ) man-made global warming be the main cause of all kind of disagreeable event .  This essay identify some of the weakness in the evidence present in support of the mainstream view , include weakness in the claim that 97 % of climate scientist believe in anthropogenic global warming , in the claim that global temperature will rise much faster than they have be rise , and in the ( implicit ) claim that the horrify worst-case scenario present by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change represent the likely scenario to 2100 in the absence of radical action start now .  Policy Recommendations Every sensible person agree that ( 1 ) global warming have be happen over most of the second half of the twentieth century and on into the twenty first , and ( 2 ) most of it to date be due to greenhouse gas emission .  But too much policy discussion about global warming be polarize and lock into a “ syndrome of exaggeration ” .  The mainstream view talk of come disaster , catastrophe , even extinction , short of urgent and massive action on a global scale .  Every sensible person agree that ( 1 ) global warming have be happen over most of the second half of the twentieth century and on into the twenty first , and ( 2 ) most of it to date be due to greenhouse gas emission .  Finally , notice that the abstract be not rat a to whether they endorse the idea of a global warming crisis or catastrophe ; only a to whether they endorse the idea of human cause of global warming .  notably ( 1 ) in fudge the distinction between agree that human action have some role in global warming and agree that human action explain most global warming ; ( 2 ) in not ask whether .  We have see that the standard global warming model have a powerful built-in bias to exaggerate the rate of future temperature rise , a see in ( most of ) them “ hindcasting ” temperature rise several time faster than actually observe .

***** But what 's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it 's be cause by human ? .  How do we know human be responsible for global warming ? .  They reveal there would have be little global warm - and possibly some cool - over the 20th and 21st Centuries , if only natural factor have be influence the climate .
***** By now it 's common knowledge that the rapid warming of the past century be not natural .  This unintentional side effect of the Industrial Revolution have prove useful in mask some greenhouse warming .  While these particle be effective at help counteract some of the global warming in the mid to late 20th century , their impact be diminish , because since the 1980s pollution have be gradually clear up .

***** American opponent and critic of the scientific consensus over man-made global warming have be much more vocal and influential than their counterpart in continental Europe ; in France several scientist and intellectuals1 do take issue with the position of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) but they tend to be rather isolated and marginal figure with little or no impact on public policy .  Most recently , concern raise by the scientific community about the issue of global warming have lead strong environmentalist such a Bill McKibben and Al Gore to seek new legislation to curtail it negative impact on the planet .  ” 33 Given such circumstance , denial appear to be a more desirable strategy than a devastating reappraisal of one ’ s deeply hold belief .  Sallie James argue that cap and trade be a losing proposition because it would have an insignificant impact on the earth ’ s temperature while damage the competitiveness of the American economy .
***** In isolation and ignore environmental effect , a carbon tax negatively impact output and employment and make the tax code less progressive .  A carbon tax pair with a lump-sum rebate would increase the tax code ’ s progressivity significantly , but impact employment and output negatively .  For instance , use carbon tax revenue to reduce a more distorting type of tax can have a positive impact on the economy .  A paper by Metcalf and Weisbach ( 2009 ) suggest levy the carbon tax on fossil fuel when they enter the economy .  [ 19 ] Sample Carbon Tax Proposal To illustrate the revenue , economic , and distributional impact of a carbon tax , we model a sample carbon tax enact by the federal government .
***** A carbon tax put a monetary price on the real cost impose on our economy , our community and our planet by greenhouse gas emission and the global warming they cause .

Since the carbon tax be introduce , Swedens economy have grow by more than 100 per cent , and the country recently rank fourth in the world on economic competitiveness .
***** 1 A cap-and-trade paradox In recent work , I argue that this focus in much of the literature on energy-intensive industry be misguide because it focus on the wrong issue ( competitiveness of particular sector ) and neglect the fact that the output of these industry ( especially energy and steel ) be use throughout the economy ( Gros 2009 ) .  Given that it be usually assume that the supply of export from China and other emerge market economy be rather price elastic , even small change in relative price could have a considerable impact on trade flow .  Estimates of the emission embody in international trade have to be base on input-output matrix in order to take into account the way energy input be use throughout the economy .

***** Since we dont know with absolute certainty just how sensitive demand be to change in price , a case can be make for prefer one policy over the other .  If youre more concerned about the economic disruption associate with uncertainty about price , then a carbon tax would provide more certainty on that front .
***** In this post , well recap what the economics tell u about this choice , and well offer a challenge to the general consensus in favour of a carbon tax .  If the authority instead auction emission permit then there be certainty about the volume of emission , but uncertainty about the price .

The evidence show that environmental regulation can lead to statistically significant adverse effect on trade , employment , plant location , and productivity in the short run , in particular in a well-identified subset of pollution- and energy-intensive sector , but that these impact be small relative to general trend in production .  As measure to address competitiveness impact be increasingly incorporate into the design of environmental regulation , future research will be need to assess the validity and effectiveness of such measure and to ensure they be compatible with the environmental objective of the policy .  IntroductionEver since the first major environmental regulation be enact in the 1970s , there have be much debate about their potential impact on the competitiveness of affected firm .  This be a particularly troubling problem for global pollutant such a carbon dioxide , because it mean that on top of the economic impact on domestic firm , abatement effort will be offset to some extent by increase emission in other region .  By synthesize the evidence , we also hope to inform the political debate concern the economic impact of environmental regulation .  We then review the exist evidence , first discuss the impact of relative environmental stringency on trade , industry location , and employment , and then examine the effect on productivity and innovation , which could also impact firm ’ competitiveness .  Changes to technology outcome , for example , may trigger cost impact or firm response to change .
***** These approach be appeal to policymakers because they often combine the certainty associate with a give emission standard with the flexibility of allow firm to pursue the least costly abatement method .  An EIS be a report specify potential environmental damage and alternative approach to the agency action to minimize adverse impact .
***** The Ehrlich-Simon bet be motivate by the question of whether the world be ‘ run out ’ of natural resource , but an interval of 10 year be unlikely to tell u much about the long-run scarcity of raw material .  The basic framework of supply and demand ( see Units 8 and 11 ) tell u why .  Similarly , the process of global warming can be self-reinforcing due , for example , to it impact on Arctic ice cover , a we will see later in Section 20 .  12 , the economy be embed within society , but also within the ecosystem .  Resources flow from nature into the human economy .  Scientific evidence suggest that the planet have a limited capacity to absorb the pollutant that the human economy generates .
***** Cap and trade differs from a tax in that it provide a high level of certainty about future emission , but not about the price of those emission ( carbon tax do the inverse ) .
***** It 's timely for this body to take a position should we choose to do so , and I recommend that we do , on this question of climate legislation , the economy and the economy writ large .  The small apple in the beginning assume that the revenue from such a system get recycle into the economy .  And in term of economic efficiency , there be a lot of way you can put that money back into the economy , but we 're try to drive a significant change in consumer behavior and a substitution of other energy source .  So this sort of a change would have a large impact on producer and generator of electricity , not so much on an individual household .  The trap door seem very , very weak ; that we ought to consider something if cost go amok and that could have a devastating effect on the economy .  report that 's call -- I think it 's call a fair and just transition to a low carbon , green economy , that really do grapple with a number of issue , include cap and trade .
***** Deciding whether ( and how ) the government should respond to the risk of climate change require consider the extent to which anthropogenic climate change be actually occur ; the need for coordination with other country ’ carbon policy ; and the ethic of impose added cost ( especially while the economy be weak ) in exchange for the uncertain prospect of long-term gain .  At it core , the problem come down to apply market pressure in an arena in which property right do not operate a they do in the rest of our economy — and in which market therefore often need some help to function properly .  And it can achieve environmental goal at a low cost ( to producer , consumer , and the broad economy ) than more prescriptive government regulation that , say , require the use of certain clean technology or restrict production — the sort of policy , in other word , that form the core of our environmental regulation today .  But on the whole , market-based regulation be a far good way to balance the need of the economy and the need of the environment .
***** CHAPTER TWOWhat We Know About Climate Change and Its Interactions with People and Ecosystems Over the past several decade , the international and national research community have develop a progressively clear picture of how and why Earths climate be change and of the impact of climate change on a wide range of human and environmental system .  Research have also evaluate action that could be takenand in some case be already be takento limit the magnitude of future climate change and adapt to it impact .  Human-induced climate change and it impact will continue for many decade , and in some case for many century .  The ultimate magnitude of climate change and the severity of it impact depend strongly on the action that human society take to respond to these risk .  The combined impact of rise CO2 level , temperature change , and other climate change on natural ecosystem and on agriculture be describe later in this chapter and in further detail in Part II of the report .  Since the future can not be know with certainty , a large number Suggested Citation .  Projections of Sea Level Rise Projections of future sea level have be the subject of active discussion in the recent literature on climate change impact .  Compelling evidence have be assemble indicate that rapid freshwater discharge at the end of the last ice age cause abrupt ocean circulation change , which in turn lead to significant impact on regional climate .  Even if the frequency or intensity of coastal storm do not change , increase in average sea level will magnify the impact of extreme event on coastal landscape .

***** With million of good Samaritans regularly donate a portion of their paycheck to good cause , charity be booming… unfortunately , not all of the money go into them be come out the way we think .  Donate $ 10 to certain charity , and rather than the full amount ( or the full amount minus a small handling fee ) go to the advertised cause , most of it will be siphon off into the foundation ’ s executive bank account , mishandle , or otherwise misappropriate .  The amount that actually make it way to where you think it ’ s go end up represent only a tiny fraction of the donation .  Of course , we ’ ve no wish to tarnish all charity with the same brush , and by and large , most philanthropic foundation do exactly what they advertise on the tin .  If you ’ d rather your money find it way into the pocket of who it should , then maybe find yourself a good cause .

President-elect Obama have express his confidence in her , and he deserve to have his secretary of state in place at the early opportunity .  Although neither Senator Clinton nor President Clinton have a personal financial stake in the foundation , obviously it work benefit their legacy and their public service priority .  Every new foreign donation that be accept by the foundation come with the risk it will be connect in the global medium to a proximate State Department policy or decision .  The only certain way to eliminate this risk go forward be for the Clinton foundation to forswear new foreign contribution when Senator Clinton become secretary of state .  Alternatively , the Clinton Foundation and the Obama transition have work in good faith to construct a more complex approach base on disclosure and ethic review that would allow the foundation the prospect of continue to accept foreign donation deem not to have the appearance of a conflict of interest .  The agreement require , among other measure , the disclosure of all the foundation donors up to this point and annual disclosure of donation go forward and a State Department ethic review process that would evaluate propose donation from foreign government and governmental entity .  I 'm hopeful the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration will go far to ensure that the vital business of United States foreign policy upon which the security of our country rest be not encumber by perception arise from donation to the foundation .

***** Equal citizenship for African Americans be incomplete without the ability to make a decent living .  But conservative find in the report a convenient rationalization for inequality ; they argue that only racial self-help could produce the necessary change in family structure .  Yet it remain relevant today amidst current discussion of why racial inequality persist despite the passage of civil-rights legislation .  But collectively , in the spectrum of American ethnic and religious and regional group , where some get plenty and some get none , where some send eighty percent of their child to college and others pull them out of school at the 8th grade , Negroes be among the weak .  The gap between the Negro and most other group in American society be widen .  say in An American Dilemma remain true today .  Nothing like it have occur since the upheaval of the 1930 ’ s which lead to the organization of the great industrial trade union , and which in turn profoundly alter both the economy and the political scene .  , call in 1963 for a “ Domestic Marshall Plan ” to rebuild urban area and close the economic gap between black and white .  equal right and opportunity to make the best one can of one ’ s life within one ’ s capability , without fear of injustice or oppression or threat of violence , ” 2 But the evolution of American politics , with the distinct persistence of ethnic and religious group , have add a profoundly significant new dimension to that egalitarian ideal .

***** Servicemen rush home to take a job , buy a car , purchase a home in the suburb , and start a family .  3 Leading intellectual begin to deliberate on the nature of this society and the impact it be have on American citizen .  That do not change the fact that ten of million of Americans be , at this very moment , maim in body and spirit , exist at level beneath those necessary for human decency .  They be without adequate housing and education and medical care .  What we witness in the Watts area be the beginning of a stirring of a deprived people in a society who have be by-passed by the progress of the previous decade .  To illustrate , in 1966 , the percentage of rural Americans in poverty be 19 percent , compare to 14 percent for urban Americans .  In that same year , the percent of nonwhite Americans in poverty be 41 percent , in contrast to 12 percent of white Americans .
***** Single parenthood The typical family be comprise of two parent and at least one child .  A single parent be someone who have a child but no spouse or partner .

***** In 1965 , 24 percent of black infant and 3 .  1 percent of white infant be bear to single mother .  By 1990 the rate have rise to 64 percent for black infant , 18 percent for white .  Every year about one million more child be bear into fatherless family .  If we have learn any policy lesson well over the past 25 year , it be that for child live in single-parent home , the odds of living in poverty be great .  Searching for an Explanation Efforts by social scientist to explain the rise in out-of-wedlock birth have so far be unconvincing , though several theory have a wide popular following .  But a David Ellwood and Lawrence Summers have show , welfare benefit could not have play a major role in the rise of out-of-wedlock birth because benefit rise sharply in the 1960s and then fell in the 1970s and 1980s , when out-of-wedlock birth rise most .  A study by Robert Moffitt in 1992 also find that welfare benefit can account for only a small fraction of the rise in the out-of-wedlock birth ratio .
***** In addition , they sometimes have stress the extraordinary economic success observe in the competitively capitalistic society respond to individual property right , market incentive , and entrepreneurship that emerge over the past couple of century .  In contrast , the Times narrative argues that the truly exceptional dimension of the American experience be the exploitation of it black population , begin with slavery but continue to the present day ( New York Times Magazine 2019b ) .  This reassessment of the past have , of course , spread far beyond the mostly affluent and highly educate Times readership to the entire society , lead to massive demonstration , particularly after the police killing of George Floyd on May 25 , 2020 .  Beyond the riot , destruction of property , toppling of monument , and call to disband police department , major change have be come to traditionally fairly sedate venue , such a college campus .  For example , in a new collegiate expression of the ascendant cancel culture , Yale remove the name of John Calhoun and Princeton that of Woodrow Wilson ( it own president for eight year ) from building or program because of these men 's unfair or prejudicial treatment of black Americans .  There be , in my judgment , roughly speak , two different contemporary interpretation of the treatment of black in America .  The ascend new wisdom be that widespread discrimination and rejection of black by the dominant white culture have bring continue , maybe even increase , misery and despair to the black population .  I argue that in the generation after the end of the Great Depression around 1940 , include some year after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , black Americans make major progress , narrow economic differential between them and others , especially white , while discriminatory barrier begin a real decline .  Market force , especially labor market , in the middle of the twentieth century work to make good , more productive , and therefore more remunerative use of the sizable nonwhite population , benefit both black and the nation a a whole .  One century after the end of slavery , American black be make substantial progress economically , and overt racial discrimination , while still present , be in significant decline , despite some highly publicize evidence to the contrary in the American South .  Nonetheless , black economic progress be considerable in the quarter of a century before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in part because of the mass migration North but also because of decline prejudicial behavior toward Americans of African descent that have impede their participation in a vibrant capitalistic economy .

***** Child poverty be an ongoing national concern , but few be aware that it principal cause be the absence of married father in the home .  As husband disappear from the home , poverty and welfare dependence will increase , and child and parent will suffer a a result .  Since marital decline drive up child poverty and welfare dependence , and since the poor aspire to healthy marriage but lack the norm , understanding , and skill to achieve it , it be reasonable for government to take active step to strengthen marriage .  In particular , clarify the severe shortcoming of the “ child first , marriage later ” philosophy to potential parent in lower-income community should be a priority .  the absence of married father in the home .  Census , the poverty rate for single parent with child in the United States in 2009 be 37 .  The rate for married couple with child be 6 .  Being raise in a married family reduce a child ’ s probability of living in poverty by about 82 percent .  [ 1 ] Some of this difference in poverty be due to the fact that single parent tend to have less education than married couple , but even when married couple be compare to single parent with the same level of education , the married poverty rate will still be more than 75 percent low .  Nearly all child be bear to married couple .  For example , when President Lyndon Johnson launch the War on Poverty in 1964 , 93 percent of child bear in the United States be bear to married parent .
***** FUTURE DIRECTIONSdisclosure statementliterature cite AbstractThis review synthesize the historical literature on the criminalization and incarceration of black Americans for an interdisciplinary audience .  Drawing on key insight from new history in the field of American carceral study , we trace the multifaceted way in which policymakers and official at all level of government have use criminal law , police , and imprisonment a proxy for exert social control in predominantly black community from the colonial era to the present .  And a a call to action for rethink the place of prison in American society , The New Jim Crow stimulate new and critical scholarly debate over the impact of legalize racial and social control in America ( Forman 2012 ) .  For more than a decade , carceral scholar have complicate traditional understanding of the social , economic , and political force that undergird the rise of mass incarceration in America .  In addition to reinterpret Alexander 's work , their insight have demonstrate the significance of federal and local crime-control policy , the role of police , and activism within black community that both shaped and resist the expansion of the US carceral-security state .  This review underscore these dynamic with respect to the criminalization of black Americans and highlight key national and municipal development in crime-control practice and punitive policymaking that most affected black community .  In effect , the criminalization of black Americans have be , and continue to be , the canary in the coal mine for underserved and hyperpoliced community catch within the ever-expanding web of American law and order .  Most recently , historian have invoke the language of warfare and counterinsurgency to describe the US criminal legal system 's dependency on aggressive local law enforcement operation and surveillance strategy that target black and Latinx youth and political activist in particular ( Balto 2019 , Camp 2016 , Felker-Kantor 2018 , Gilmore 2007 , Hinton 2016 , Hernández 2017 , McCoy 2009 , Singh 2017 ) .

Poverty , Public Policy , Working Class , Fathers , Economic Mobility Too many American child experience the hurt from break bond at an early age .  About 35 % of American adolescent live without one of their parent , and around 40 % of American child be bear outside of marriage .  Although these kid parent be usually in a relationship or even cohabit at birth , mom and dad often break up while their child be still young .

Simply put , father-absence be the now-widespread phenomenon of child who have no close relationship with , or even knowledge of , their biological father .
***** Introduction Speaking to Detroit autoworkers in October 1980 , Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan describe what he saw a the American Dream under Democratic president Jimmy Carter .  The rise of the right affect Americans ’ everyday life in numerous way .  In many way , however , the rise of the right promise more than it deliver .  Yet from a long-term perspective , conservative achieve a subtler and more enduring transformation of American politics and society .  In the word of one historian , the conservative movement successfully “ change the term of debate and place it opponent on the defensive .  Even two-term Republican president Dwight D .  In the late 1960s and early 1970s , Black Power , affirmative action , and court-ordered busing of child between school to achieve racial balance bring “ white backlash ” in the North , often in city previously know for political liberalism .  At the same time , slow wage growth , rise price , and grow tax burden threaten many working- and middle-class citizen who long form the core of the New Deal coalition .  Liberalism no longer seem to offer the great mass of white Americans a road map to prosperity , so they search for new political solution .  He assail female welfare recipient for “ breed child a a cash crop ” and ridicule “ over-educated , ivory-tower ” intellectual who “ don ’ t know how to park a bicycle straight .
***** Many blue-collar white , key to Trump , criticize poor people a lazy and content to stay on welfare By David Lauter In 1985 , Dorean Sewell talk to The Times about raise three child in a Baltimore low-income on her salary from a fast-food restaurant , a part of a newspaper series on American attitude about poverty .  But the poll , which update a survey The Times conduct three decade ago , also illustrate how attitude about poverty have remain largely consistent over time despite dramatic economic and social change .  The opposite view that job for the poor be hard to find , that government program help people get back on their foot and that most of the poor would rather earn their own way be most widely hold among black and other minority , who have provide the strong backing to Hillary Clinton .  Much have change since the 1980s .  The number of poor Americans drop sharply in that decade , only to partially rise again , particularly during the deep recession that begin in 2007 .  Most Americans do not believe that the government bear the main burden of take care of the poor .  Asked who have the great responsibility for help the poor , just over one-third say that the government do .  Just under one in five Americans say that the poor themselves bear the great responsibility .  Among Latinos , family come in second behind government ; among black , church take second place ; Republicans be most likely to put responsibility on the poor themselves .  White Americans be less likely to call government responsible than be minority , but the difference lay almost entirely with blue-collar white those without college degree .  Attitudes toward antipoverty program also have not change much since the 1980s .  Blue-collar white be much more likely than nonwhites to view the poor a a class set apart from the rest of society trap in poverty a a more or less permanent condition .
***** entrench , multigenerational poverty be largely black ; and 2 .  Almost 70 percent of black child be bear to single mother .  Those mother be far more likely than married mother to be poor , even after a post-welfare-reform decline in child poverty .  They be also more likely to pass that poverty on to their child .  The vast majority of higher-income woman wait to have their child until they be marry .  To go back to the political and social moment before the battle break out over the Moynihan report be to return to a time before the country ’ s discussion of black poverty have harden into fix orthodoxies—before phrase like “ blame the victim , ” “ self-esteem , ” “ out-of-wedlock childbearing ” ( the term at the time be “ illegitimacy ” ) , and even “ teen pregnancy ” have become current .  While solve the black poverty problem seem an immense political challenge , a a conceptual matter it didn ’ t seem like rocket science .  Most analyst assume that once the nation remove discriminatory legal barrier and expand employment opportunity , black would advance , just a poor immigrant have .  About half of all black have move into the middle class by the mid-sixties , but now progress seem to be stall .  The rise in black income relative to that of white , steady throughout the fifty , be sputter to a halt .  More black be out of work in 1964 than in 1954 .

But now , politician and scholar - black and white , liberal and conservative - openly agree that the situation have reach such proportion that it threaten to undo the black economic gain of the past three decade .  Growing Alarm Among BlacksThe breakdown of traditional family structure be , they say , one of the underlying cause of black poverty , not only because there be no man to provide family income but also because woman on the average earn much less than men .  Moreover , many black spokesman be say for the first time that this be one of the most serious problem face their community and that it may mean that large and large proportion of come generation of black will grow up disadvantage .  Eleanor Holmes Norton , a law professor at Georgetown University who be chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Carter Administration , term the family crisis a threat to the future of black people without equal .  The problem must be resolve , the expert say , because otherwise society at large will have to pay the price , either in compensatory measure to prop up fractured life or in strife and social conflict a the gap widen between the privileged and the exclude .  Half of all family head by black woman have income below the poverty line , the study show .  The study note that in 1981 the average income of black family with two work parent be 84 percent of the average for white family where both parent work , an increase from 73 percent 13 year earlier .
***** Since at least the early 1980s , Republicans have be commit to dismantle Lyndon Johnson ’ s Great Society—a collection of program the 36th president vow would lead to “ an end to poverty and racial injustice .  the flawed notion that “ government and bureaucracy ” be the “ primary vehicle for social change .  Many signature item of Johnson ’ s legacy—from civil and vote right to environmental protection and aid to public schools—are today under assault .  Governing in an age of unmatched prosperity , the architect of the Great Society be convince that the mean to a more just society be not cut the pie into small slice so that everyone would enjoy an equal share , but bake a large pie .  Fifty year later , it ’ s perfectly legitimate to ask whether Johnson ’ s vision be adequate in a country in which few worker enjoy employer pension and health care , 31 percent of child live in single-parent family ( up from 12 percent in 1960 ) , household wage have long be stagnant , and inequality have revert to level we have not see since the eve of the Great Depression .  On the evening of November 22 , 1963 , from his bedroom at the Elms—the Johnson family ’ s stately home in Northwest Washington , D .  It be here that the new president famously declare “ unconditional war on poverty ” to a country still reel from John F .  ” Months later , when Johnson use the phrase “ Great Society ” for the first time , in speech at Ohio University on May 7 , he describe “ a society where no child will go unfed , and no youngster will go unschooled .
***** Some remnant of Johnsons idealistic Great Society survive today .  Some see the Great Society a a success , move the nation towards a more just and equitable society .  Johnsons program increase Social Security benefit , greatly aid the elderly poor ; institute Medicare and Medicaid , health care support that even conservative politician today pledge to support ; and assist African Americans in the 1960s , whose income rise by half in the decade .

Mar 10 , 2021 Members of Congress be again look to repeal the estate tax , commonly refer to a the death tax among agricultural circle .  Although the tax reform enact during the Trump Administration offer a limited repeal of the estate tax , this bill would allow for a complete repeal of the estate tax .  Some Democrat proposal have threaten an elimination of the estate tax as well a stepped-up basis .  Thune lead the Senate ’ s effort to repeal the estate tax while Congress consider the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ) in 2017 .  Although the final version of the TCJA do not repeal the death tax , the law double the individual estate and gift tax exclusion to $ 10 million ( $ 11 .  6 % of the more than 2 million family farm could potentially have farm asset that exceed the estate tax exemption .  ” Forced to divert resource If the estate tax be not eliminate , instead of spend money to improve their operation , farmer and rancher , along with all small business , will be force to continue to divert resource to pay for estate planning to account for a shifting and unpredictable tax code , AFBF say .
***** The National Republican Senatorial Committee be run two ad online and on television criticize Greenfield for her support of an estate tax .  In a 30-second TV spot release in mid-July , an Iowa farmer name Bob Witt state that 'Greenfield support Nancy Pelosi 's death tax .  This liberal tax punishes family farm … and force them to sell off instead of pa on to the next generation .  ” Analysis First , we 'll check the claim that Greenfield support the federal inheritance tax .  Then we 'll review whether this tax have force family to sell their farm .  In her op-ed , Greenfield oppose a Republican proposal to repeal the estate tax .  She write , 'Repealing the estate tax , a this bill do , help the wealthy Americans - it do nothing for small business owner and farm .  With so many of the tax break in the House bill go to corporation and pass-through , our farm will be leave hold the bag .  ” So Greenfield do support the federal tax .
***** Congress be consider a provision that would hit family business with tax they cant pay .  That mean family business would have to pay tax on their appreciate value even if that value be still lock up in the business .  Eliminating the step-up would force family business and rancher to liquidate when an owner dy and to lay off employee while bring in little revenue for Uncle Sam .  Both time it have to be reinstate because of the devastate effect on family-owned business .  Congress try that in 1997 for inherit family-held business but the exception be too narrow to benefit anyone , and widen them would have be tantamount to repeal the estate tax altogether .  Eliminating the step-up would devastate family-owned business , ranch and farm .  The disruption that it would create for small family business and farmer and family asset be not worth the pain .  The piece of this that I find most troubling be that all of a sudden , for the first time , we be go to be tax unrealized capital gain .  When you look at tax unrealized capital gain , what you be do be open up a Pandoras box that wont be close for a long , long time .  If the functional benefit of the step-up in basis be eliminate and transfer subject to the estate tax also become subject to income tax many business would be force to pay tax on appreciated gain , include simple inflation , from prior generation of family ownersdespite not receive a penny of actual gain .  Making these change could force business operator to sell property , lay off employee , or close their door just to cover these new tax obligation .  Even if there be a carve-out for farm that stay within a family , he worry that his child would be face with a tax bill in the million if they choose to sell the family land after inherit it .  Removing stepped-up basis would require the heir of the property to pay tax gain base on the original purchase price of the farmland rather than the market value on the date of inheritance .

The policy propose by Biden would tax heir on the gain in value for asset such a farm land ( the current value minus it original purchase price ) .

At the 1974 World Food Conference , the term `` food security `` be define with an emphasis on supply ; food security be define a the `` availability at all time of adequate , nourishing , diverse , balance and moderate world food supply of basic foodstuff to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuation in production and price `` .  The first World Food Summit , hold in 1996 , state that food security `` exist when all people , at all time , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary need and food preference for an active and healthy life .  `` 34 Similarly , household food security be consider to exist when all member , at all time , have access to enough food for an active , healthy life .  5 Individuals who be food secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation .  6 Food insecurity , on the other hand , be define by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) a a situation of `` limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe food or limit or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable food in socially acceptable way `` .  7 Food security incorporate a measure of resilience to future disruption or unavailability of critical food supply due to various risk factor include drought , ship disruption , fuel shortage , economic instability , and war .

There is a precedent for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election.
***** When Washington , in his Farewell Address , publish in September 1796 , announce his intention to retire , the nation face it first contest presidential election .  Each party name two presidential candidate , for under the original Constitution , each member of the electoral college be to cast two ballot for President .  The winner of the presidential election be the individual who receive the large number of vote , if it constitute a majority of the vote cast .  In the event that no candidate receive a majority of vote , or that two candidate tie with a majority of vote , the House of Representatives be to decide the election , with each state , regardless of size , have a single vote .  Seven state permit popular voting in this election .
***** Robert Borks nomination draw attention to the process The process provide by the Constitution allow the President to nominate a Supreme Court Justice , with just the Senate ( and not the House ) empower to approve the nomination by a simple majority vote .  In recent year , Anthony Kennedy and David Souter be nominate by Republican Presidents and confirm by a Democrat-controlled Senate .
***** `` It seem clear President Obama make this nomination not , not with the intent of see the nominee confirm , but in order to politicize it for purpose of the election , `` McConnell say .  A majority of the Senate have decide to fulfill it constitutional role of advice and consent by withhold support for the nomination during a presidential election year , with million of vote have be cast in highly charge contest .  Judge Bork learn even after be unanimously confirm for a circuit court judgeship , the confirmation process for the Supreme Court be unlike any other .
***** The agency also defend suit contest it dismissal of administrative complaint , petition for review of Commission decision regard the presidential public funding program and civil suit challenge the constitutionality of provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act ( FECA ) and the validity of the Commissions regulation .  Each case list have a dedicate page include a case summary , as well a link to court opinion and related document file in the suit .
***** The last president to nominate justice in the twilight of his presidency be Lyndon Johnson ( D ) in 1968 .  Andrew Jackson nominate two justice on his last full day in office in 1837 .  However , he be nominate in November 1987 , 15 month before Reagan leave office .  Senate quickly make public comment on whether President Barack Obama ( D ) should nominate a replacement .  The president and the Senate should get to work without delay to nominate , consider and confirm the next justice to serve on the Supreme Court .

Wind power is the most undependable form of renewable energy.
***** Sydney , NSW solar panel Melbourne , Victoria solar panel Brisbane , Queensland solar panel Adelaide , SA solar panel Perth , WA solar panel Hobart , Tasmania solar panel Darwin , NT solar panel Wind power involve convert wind energy into electricity by use wind turbine .  A wind turbine usually have three propellers-like blade call rotor .  On average , wind tower in residential setting be about 20m high .  The reason why the tower be so tall be that wind be strong high from the ground and there ’ s less of a buffeting effect .  So in a way , wind energy be another form of solar power .  A wind turbine capture the wind , which then produce a renewable energy source .  Because wind be a source of energy which be non-polluting and renewable , the turbine create power without use fossil fuel .
***** Offshore wind power isn ’ t a viable renewable energy option .  Offshore wind have exist for about 20 year , and have become an important part of Europe ’ s energy mix .  Europe ’ s total installed offshore wind capacity be about 2 gigawatts in 2009 .  Some of the United States ’ best wind resource lie off the coast .  Offshore wind power be too expensive .  Offshore wind can supply electricity at competitive price today .  According to a 2007 Black & Veatch report , the cost of electricity from offshore wind power could range between 8 .  As the offshore wind industry mature , the cost of energy will continue to fall ; the same can not be say of non-renewables and nuclear power plant .  Environmental organization and local resident oppose offshore wind farm .  Additionally , wind turbine could have a side benefit of decrease temperature at high latitude , offset the anticipated warming cause by greenhouse gas .  Renewable energy , like solar and wind power , use too much space and cause “ energy sprawl .
***** Visually identifiable by it characteristic turbine , wind power have be use on a utility scale for only a few decade .  Wind-generating capacity in the United States grow 39 percent per year from 2004 to 2009 , and be expect to grow more rapidly a demand for renewable energy increase .  [ 1 ] As the wind energy industry continue to grow , it will provide many opportunity for worker in search of new career .  These career extend beyond the wind farm .  The wind energy industry have experience rapid growth in the past decade .  According to the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) , in 2000 , instal wind energy capacity in the United States be under 3,000 megawatt .  In 2009 , 10,010 megawatt of new wind energy capacity be instal , more than in any previous year .  As wind energy continue to grow in popularity , the development of American wind farm be expect to increase .  Of course , the pace of wind energy development be influence by current economic condition .  Despite this growth , wind power be only a tiny segment of the national energy market .  In 2009 , wind energy make up 1 .  However , wind power account for about 50 percent of renewable energy , which include wind , solar , hydroelectric , and geothermal power , as well a energy from biomass and wood or wood-derived product .

***** Renewable energy describe a collection of energy technology , i .  , solar , wind , geothermal derive from source that be never-ending and can be replenish time after time .  Most country across the world heavily depend on fossil fuel ( oil , coal and natural gas ) a source of energy to power their economy .  Fossil fuel be non-renewable form of energy , mean they utilize limited resource that will ultimately deplete , hence , drive up overall energy cost .  These country have respond to the threat by step up campaign to embrace renewable form of energy like solar and wind .  what be the real benefit of use renewable energy ? .  While there be certainly advantage and disadvantage to switch to renewable energy , it be quite arguable that the benefit of use such source outweigh the shortcoming of it , especially in the future .  The benefit of renewable energy source be breathtaking .  While we may not entirely be in a position to fully switch over to renewable energy source just quite yet ( require a balance of renewable energy and other source for now ) , it be imperative that we look ahead to the future .  If solar and wind plant be distribute over a large geographical location , there can be minimal electricity generation interruption because weather disruption in one location can not be the same in other location .  This renewable energy generate technology like solar panel and wind turbine either have few or no move part .  The more you ’ re use renewable energy for your power need , the less you ’ ll be dependent on import energy , and the more you ’ ll contribute to the country ’ s energy independence a a whole .

***** Wind energy offer many advantage , which explain why it 's one of the fastest-growing energy source in the world .  Research effort be aim at address the challenge to great use of wind energy .  Read on to learn more about the benefit of wind power and some of the challenge it be work to overcome .  Land-based utility-scale wind be one of the lowest-priced energy source available today , cost 1 .  Because the electricity from wind farm be sell at a fixed price over a long period of time ( e .  20+ year ) and it fuel be free , wind energy mitigate the price uncertainty that fuel cost add to traditional source of energy .  Wind energy do n't pollute the air like power plant that rely on combustion of fossil fuel , such a coal or natural gas , which emit particulate matter , nitrogen oxide , and sulfur dioxide—causing human health problem and economic damage .  Although wind power plant have relatively little impact on the environment compare to conventional power plant , concern exist over the noise produce by the turbine blade and visual impact to the landscape .
***** The sun doesnt always shine , the wind doesnt always blow .  One way to see this be by look at the capacity factor of solar plant and wind farm .  For example , our local power provider be build 100 and 200 MW solar plant , and Mountain Views Googleplex get power from the ~600 MW Altamont Pass Wind Farm .  If you multiply that power by time , you get a measure of the maximum amount of energy it can generate over a period of time .  So , for example , if you be to run a 100 MW solar plant at full power for a year ( that would be impossible because of night and cloud , but just pretend ) , then it would generate 100 * 365 * 24 = 876,000 MW-hours = 876 GW-hours ( GWh ) of energy .  In reality , the solar plant would not come close to produce that amount of energy in one year because the sun doesnt shine 24x7 .  ( 1 ) The chart below show the capacity factor of different type of energy in the US .  This have make coal power more expensive .  But wind ( in green ) be also make improvement , and those be relate more to technology than to market force .  You may be wonder how technology can make more wind power from the same wind .
***** In global energy ranking , one country stand out .  China be the world ’ s hungry consumer of energy worldwide — demand the energetic equivalent of almost 3 .  China be also the world ’ s most prolific producer of wind energy , with the capacity to make more than twice as much a the second-largest generator , the United States .  Recognizing this hunger and the damage that a long-term reliance on fossil fuel would have , the Chinese government have make plan to address the country ’ s energy need .  And science and technology — in field such a battery technology , photovoltaics and energy management — be at the heart of those plan .

At Marquette , he be elect to the student senate , and twice seek but fail to get elected president of the student body .  He run for the Wisconsin State Assembly the same year that he lose his bid to be student president at Marquette , lose the Assembly race as well .  Part of Act 10 have already be strike down by a federal judge , and , a I note earlier , the wisdom of Walker ’ s power play will be test in the June 5th recall election .  Needless to say , Walker ’ s policy that attack poor woman by cut off fund to Planned Parenthood ; his slashing of education budget while give tax break to wealthy corporation ; and his pursuit of similar radical Republican action all raise serious moral issue .  A lengthy article could ( and should ) be write about both , but suffice it here to note that his ethic problem go back to his Marquette University day , when the college newspaper call him “ unfit ” for student office .

Over the past 3 year , we have protect student at risk while invest in education reform that support bold and courageous leadership at both the State and at the local level .  TIMEFRAME FOR SEQUESTRATION Fiscal year 2013 be a little more than 2 month away , and sequestration kick in 3 month after that on January 2 , 2013 , so it 's critically important that we and the American people fully understand the consequence of sequestration and take step to avoid it now .

I have university-level committee work ( faculty do a lot of administrative work to help the university function ) .  I attend presentation by visit scholar and student , and committee meeting for the student I advise .  I go into the field or the lab when I can but most of my time these day be spend on proposal ( which have a 6 % success rate , and which bring in money to the university in the form of 46 % overhead ) .  I give talk at other university ( typically unpaid ) , and I be a resource for journalist and general inquiry from the community .  So , Governor , when you say work harder , I want to know if youre really ask me to add another 15-20 hour to my week ? .  Which of the above can I stop do without do a major disservice to my department , my university , my student , or my field ? .

But Sessions ' press secretary , Jack Bonnikson , tell u that there 's `` an opt-out provision `` that allow the secretary to avoid fence-building .  So , while we ca n't say for certain a judge would n't take liberty interpret the language of the legislation , on it face , what Sessions ' office call an `` opt-out `` provision just offer the administration considerable choice about where to put fence - not whether to build it .  `` This provision just give DHS discretion not to build a fence at a particular location , not discretion to not build a fence at all , `` say Stephen Yale-Loer , an immigration attorney who teach at Cornell Law .  Our ruling Sessions say the immigration bill `` have a specific provision that say that Secretary Napolitano do not have to build any fence if she choose not to .  His press secretary point to an `` opt-out `` provision in the bill .  But it would take a dramatic leap of legal interpretation to argue that provision allow Napolitano to skip fence-building altogether .  Legal expert we speak to say , instead , it give her discretion about where to build border fencing .

Neither be other now-failed or fail green energy company on which the President recklessly gamble billion in taxpayer dollar .  If the abysmal performance of his green energy gamble be not enough , there be more reason why President Obamas plan to risk billion more on his green energy vision be bad for America .  Picking Winners and Losers Is Not an Energy Policy Gambling away even more taxpayer money on risky green energy bet will not lower gas price , create desperately need job , or jumpstart the American economy .

***** The purpose of this hearing be to focus on the progress that the Department of Energy have make in implement the Recovery Act in the year that have elapse since it be pass .  This be an important effort , both to create high quality job in the near term and also to begin to reverse the course that we 've be on of under invest in our country 's competitiveness in clean energy technology .  In many case , program be either never fund before or be fund at a level that be a fraction of what be provide in the Recovery Act .  The energy infrastructure need of the country be so substantial that I think we can only regard these investment a a downpayment .  If we can get the market incentives a they should be and provide some of the initial support that 's need , I believe there be substantial private-sector fund ready to be invest in these area .  We 've hear testimony before here in the committee that the scale of potential for investment in the energy sector dwarf previous investment that be make in the information sector or in biotechnology .  So , if we 're to similarly lead in clean energy and reap the associated benefit in economic and energy security , it will take a sustained commitment and a urgency of purpose to do that .  I think the Recovery Act have have that a one of it purpose , and we 're anxious to hear how that 's come and what to expect in the future .  As many of you know , I do not support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act last year .  During the debate on it I detail some of the concern that I have at that time , include those that be relate to the energy sector , that it be not timely , target , and temporary , a we have hop , that green job , that shovel-ready project would not materialize a promise , and that unprecedented Federal spending be not the only way to overcome our economic challenge .  We 're here to review just one part of it , and that be a focus on the Department of Energy .  The DOE receive nearly $ 37 billion .

Among other thing , Carter spend his four short year deal with 1979 energy crisis and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident a nuclear engineer by training , Carter insist on visit the damage plant himself .  Carters solar thermal panel on the White House roof be see a symbolic of his solar policy and political failure ; instal in 1979 , the system be remove by his successor Ronald Regan .  In 1978 , Carter initiate the Solar Domestic Policy Review and the following year announce his solar message to Congress , which establish an ambitious goal for 20 % of electricity from solar and renewable source by 2020 and commit US $ 1 billion to that effort .  Never mind that even 12 year after that target date , solar now only account for less than 1 % of US electricity generation .  After spend on import oil have balloon to US $ 45 billion in 1977 , Carter say at the opening of the centre in Golden .  Its energy will not run out .
***** In an at time passionate , occasionally jovial but largely monotonous debate , during which Romney be widely consider to have come out strong , the energy battle be largely miss .

Most importantly the $ 90 billion for clean energy initiative doesn ’ t just go into wind and solar , nor even the bulk of it .

Single firefighter , police officer and nurse who earn the median salary in those middle-class-sounding job , and with no child and standard income tax deduction , would pay high effective tax rate than hedge fund manager , once we factor in payroll tax .  But a single truck driver earn the median salary would pay a slightly low rate than the typical hedge fund manager .  And once we consider other hypothetical situation add in a dependent child , or a nonworking spouse , or both the hedge fund manager pay a high effective rate than the other occupation at the median pay level .

Thats still the case for all except the truck driver if they have one dependent child and file a head of household .  Sanders have a point that some in the profession he cite would pay high effective tax rate once we factor in payroll tax than what a hedge fund manager ( or someone who earn money through investment rather than wage ) might pay .

***** I 'm delighted to be join by my colleague on this discussion about adult stem cell research .  This be a noncontroversial area in stem cell .  We 've all hear a lot about stem cell .  The adult stem cell area , umbilical cord- blood stem cell be one that nobody disagree with , that everybody be supportive of .  Everybody be supportive of the scientific research , and the thing that be take place be absolutely profound -- I would put in the category of miraculous and answer to prayer .  I think we need to continue the funding aggressively in the field adult stem cell research , in push that forward so that we can find more cure for more type of disease that ravage the body and that hurt u all .  We will not be deal with the issue of embryonic stem cell today in the hearing .  The hearing 's focus on adult stem cell .  There be a controversial area on stem cell , in the embryonic field .  And have chair this Subcommittee in the past , I 'm acutely aware that this issue generate such passion that it be almost physiologically impossible to be unaware of the politics of stem cell research .  And I come to this issue in a nonpartisan way with the view that I think while the research show that use adult stem cell can help some people , there be million of Americans who suffer from a host of devastate disease , and their valiantly supportive family , who I believe deserve more .

***** Endnotes Introduction The discovery , isolation , and culturing of human embryonic stem cell have be describe a one of the most significant breakthrough in biomedicine of the century .  ( 1 ) This description would be warrant by virtue of the biological uniqueness of these cell alonetheir ability to self-renew infinitely while retain a remarkable capacity to differentiate into any form of cell tissue .  But as well a this , the culturing of embryonic stem cell hold tremendous potential for the development of new form of regenerative medicine to treat debilitate or fatal condition that would not otherwise be curable .  ( 2 ) It be somewhat of an irony that the discovery of cell with such a tremendous potential for improve and prolong our own life , should bring with it some of the most trenchant and intractable question about the value of life itself .  The harvesting of embryonic stem cell result in the destruction of the embryo from which they be harvest .  The current paper will confine it primary focus to the first set of problem , since many of the salient ethical issue about clone will arise , a it turn out , in connection with embryonic stem cell research .  What , in principle , be ethically at issue with destructive embryo research ? .  What be important when it come to judge the value of the potential consequence of destructive embryo research ? .

***** Including Bioethics , Excluding Debate AbstractThis study probe into what public Chinese stem cell scientist involve in define what be ‘ good research practice ’ .  Thomas Gieryn in 1983 argue that scientist draw up boundary between the realm of ‘ real science ’ and that of ‘ pseudoscience ’ in order to claim and defend their own territory .  The aim be to protect the autonomy of scientific research and to elicit financial support and political backup ( Gieryn , American Sociological Review , 48 ( 6 ) , 781 .  It show how scientist use both ‘ science ’ and ‘ bioethics ’ boundary to demarcate their own territory and to exclude certain public from debate in the field .  By elaborate Gieryn 's concept of boundary work in the new and different context of bioethical science regulation , the article show how Chinese stem cell scientist , by use both kind of boundaries—between science and pseudoscience and between ethical and non-ethical science—at the same time welcome and abhor bioethical research regulation .  It show how the self-awareness of scientist a global actor in stem cell science have lead to a moral economy of science and ethic involve global boundary rather than local condition .  ChinaStem cell researchBoundary makingResearch regulationBioethicsPublic discussion 1 Introduction .  Although much have be write on the socio-economic development of technology and their regulation , few study exist on the way in which Chinese scientist regard their particular field of work in a social and global context .  In Europe , however , the view of scientist on the relation between their work and society have increasingly become the object of research since the 1980s ( e .  Gieryn show how , through boundary making , scientist ' try to expand their authority to other knowledge field , monopolise professional authority and protect their autonomy over professional activity .
***** Unfortunately the Huntingtin protein interacts with many other protein and affect multiple process in our cell , and so exactly how it contribute to disease progression remain unknown .  To study this question , scientist use model of the disease .  Stem cell be be use to develop these model to study the disease and how it progress .  For example , induce pluripotent ( iPS ) cell can be make from the muscle or skin of HD patient .  The iPS cell obtain in this way have the same genetic code a the people affect by HD , and have be make from people with different number of CAG repeat .  When these different iPS cell be use to make MSNs , the neuron with long CAG repeat be more vulnerable to different stress and show many of the characteristic of the disease a it occur in patient .
***** Tue , 31 Aug 2010First Tests for Stem Cell Therapy Are NearEven a supporter of human embryonic stem cell research be reel from last week 's sudden cutoff of federal funding , another portentous landmark be quietly approach .  the world 's first attempt to carefully test the cell in people .  Scientists be poise to inject cell create from embryonic stem cell into some patient with a progressive form of blindness and others with devastate spinal cord injury .  But beyond be loathsome to those with moral objection to any research use cell from human embryo , the test be worry many proponent .  Mon , 30 Aug 2010Stem Cell Biology and Its ComplicationsThe renew debate over embryonic stem cell highlight the advance and complication that have arise in the field since it controversial beginning .  The cell be a sort of blank slate , pluck from human embryo just a few day after fertilization .  They tantalize scientist because they could in theory turn into any of the body 's 200 mature cell type , from blood to brain to liver to heart .  They could be use to study and treat disease and to study the basic biology of what determine a cell 's destiny—why a heart cell become a heart cell , for example , instead of a brain cell .  In order to get stem cell , embryo must be destroy .  It be this fact that lead to the court ruling [ last ] Monday block most federal financing for embryonic stem cell research .
***** 68 ( 2019 ) Cite this article AbstractIn recent year , stem cell therapy have become a very promising and advanced scientific research topic .  This paper be a review focus on the discovery of different stem cell and the potential therapy base on these cell .  The genesis of stem cell be follow by laboratory step of controlled stem cell culturing and derivation .  Quality control and teratoma formation assay be important procedure in as the property of the stem cell test .
***** Stem cell be powerful tool in biology and medicine .  What can scientist do with these cell to exploit their incredible potential ? .  The light-sensitive cell in the eye , locate in a thin layer of tissue call the retina , be damage and stop working .  The egg 's genetic material have be remove and an adult cell nucleus be inject in it place .  What if those die cell in the retina could be repair or replace ? .  They be inject replacement cell into the back of the eye to repair the retina .  The company run the trial , Advanced Cell Technology , make the replacement eye cell from human embryonic stem cell .  Stem cell be powerful .  They be pluripotent , which mean they can transform into any one of the 220 cell type in the human body .  One stem cell can also divide to produce million more stem cell .  The potential for stem cell to renew themselves , or to create new tissue , be almost infinite .  These property make stem cell an important tool in the lab and in medicine .
***** The context for the introduction of the Bill be a recent unilateral decision take by UCC to permit the granting of licence to carry out embryo-destructive research on stem cell take from embryo which have be destroy , but perhaps not in this jurisdiction .  This decision have be take in the context of a complete lack of legislation in the area of stem cell research in Ireland .  The Bill be a carefully consider and progressive response to the wonderful therapeutic success from adult stem cell research on an almost weekly basis .  It provide for the maximum possible support for such productive and non-controversial stem cell research through the prohibition of unethical , non-productive embryo stem cell research .  Some journalist , accountant and scientist from area outside embryology may disagree , but such a disagreement be not find on the relevant science , but rather on ideology and prior moral assumption .  However , not everyone here will think this be sufficient reason to turn our back on research which may result in treatment for debilitate disease .  Already , ethically solid adult stem cell research have result in 73 treatment for disease such a Crohn 's and cancer .  It have also provide promise research in the area of Parkinson 's disease , but there be no cure yet .  In America alone , adult stem cell research have lead to well over 1,200 clinical trial .  On the other hand , research on human embryo , which be ethically controversial , far from lead to a single treatment , have not even lead to one clinical trial anywhere in the world , despite hundred of million of euro be pour into it over the past decade .  The failure of embryo stem cell research be due not only to it inefficacy , but also to the fact that many of the rat treat by it form tumour due to the totally plastic or totipotent nature of the embryo stem cell .
***** Recently , scientist have report some important finding from experiment conduct upon human stem cell .  Yet the stem cell use in these study be usually take from abort fetus or from embryo ( zygote ) create in the laboratory .  According to Jewish law and tradition , be it permissible to utilize human embryo and aborted fetus in stem cell research ? .  [ 1 ] Stem cell be a type of cell find in the human body at all stage of development .  embryonic , fetal , and adult ( in this context , an “ adult ” stem cell refers to a stem cell that occur in the human organism after birth ) .  While all other cell type , such a heart cell or skin cell , be specialize or commit to conduct specific biological function , the stem cell be unique in that it be uncommitted to any specific function and remain so until it receive a signal to develop into a specialized cell .  All stem cell be capable of renew themselves and of become specialize or differentiate to yield the cell type of the particular tissue from which they originate ; when the tissue become damage or destroy , the stem cell enable the body to restore them .  Yet there be some important difference among these stem cell .  Some stem cell be “ pluripotent ” .  ( The derivation of adult stem cell do not pose similar concern ; a we have note , however , fetal and embryonic stem cell offer much good prospect for research .
***** Stem cell be special human cell that be able to develop into many different cell type .  This can range from muscle cell to brain cell .  Researchers believe that stem cell-based therapy may one day be use to treat serious illness such a paralysis and Alzheimer disease .  Types of stem cell Stem cell be divide into 2 main form .  They be embryonic stem cell and adult stem cell .  The embryonic stem cell use in research today come from unused embryo .
***** There be many different type of stem cell that come from different place in the body or be form at different time in our life .  These include embryonic stem cell that exist only at the early stage of development and various type of “ tissue-specific ” or “ adult ” stem cell that appear during fetal development and remain in our body throughout life .  Our body use different type of tissue-specific stem cell to fit a particular purpose .  Tissue-specific stem cell be limit in their potential and largely make the cell type find in the tissue from which they be derive .  For example , the blood-forming stem cell ( or hematopoietic stem cell ) in the bone marrow regenerate the blood , while neural stem cell in the brain make brain cell .  A neural stem cell win ’ t spontaneously make a blood cell and likewise a hematopoietic stem cell win ’ t spontaneously make a brain cell .  Thus , it be unlikely that a single cell type could be use to treat a multitude of unrelated disease that involve different tissue or organ .
***** Summary Stem cell be cell with the potential to develop into many different type of cell in the body .  There be two main type of stem cell .  embryonic stem cell and adult stem cell .

***** The implication of do so unnerve u .  If James Madison , the principal architect of the Constitution , could hold people in bondage his entire life , refuse to free a single soul even upon his death , then what do that say about our nation ’ s founder ? .  We the people would much rather have the Disney version of history , in which villain be easily spot , suffer never last long , hero invariably prevail and life always get well .  We prefer to pick and choose what aspect of the past to hold on to , gladly jettison that which make u uneasy .  Our discomfort with hard history and our fondness for historical fiction also lead u to make bad public policy .  It take African Americans more than a century to eliminate these legal barrier to equality , but that have not be enough to erase race-based disparity in every aspect of American life , from education and employment to wealth and well-being .  Our narrow understanding of the institution , however , prevents u from see this long legacy and lead policymakers to try to fix people instead of address the historically root cause of their problem .

Now , I think all of u be agree that war be probably man 's great stupidity and I think peace be the dream that live in the heart of everyone wherever he may be in the world , but unfortunately , unlike a family quarrel , it do n't take two to make a war .  With our great belief in religious freedom in our country , we have always say those whose religion specifically prohibit them , such a our Quakers , from take human life , we offer them military service in a noncombat role such a be medic and so forth , and they have a great and honorable history , people of this kind , of serve in our war in that capacity .

Whatever the ultimate fate of Republicans ’ Better Care Reconciliation Act , Democrats require some care and reconciliation within their own rank , give the spirit of recrimination that prove so costly to them last year .  Two broad camp dominate Democratic health politics .  They support the broad vision behind the ACA , which be to expand care and coverage through meaningful , hard-fought but fundamentally incremental reform to our current system .  The other camp , further left and typically identify with Bernie Sanders , support some version of single-payer health care under the moniker Medicare for All .  Last year , the health policy community go heavily for Clinton , in part because she be the likely winner , in part because her plan reflect granular mastery of policy detail , and in part because single payer be a heavy political lift that frighten million of Americans who be happy with their current coverage .  These activist demand something big—ideally single payer , but at the very least something ambitious and transformative that go beyond tinker with the ACA .

***** 1093/isr/viy008 Abstract Existing research on exceptionalism in foreign policy suggest a number of confrontational feature make it a threat to peaceful international relation .  Largely base on US and European case , and hardly ever take a comparative approach , this literature overlook a variety of exceptionalisms in non-Western country , include so call “ rise power ” such a China and India .  A comparison between exceptionalist foreign policy discourse of the United States , China , India , and Turkey show that exceptionalism be neither exclusive to the United States , nor a “ new ” phenomenon within rise power , nor necessarily confrontational , unilateralist , or exemptionalist .  In order to systematize different version of exceptionalism , we then propose four ideal type , each of which reflect exceptionalism 's common trait of a claim to moral superiority and uniqueness but diverges across other important dimension , with implication for it potentially offensive character .  discourse , exceptionalism , foreign policy Introduction1 A steady tradition in international relation ( IR ) scholarship study and attribute exceptionalism to the United States ( US ) a a particular characteristic informing and constitute it foreign policy ( Cha 2015a ; Lepgold and McKeown 1995 ; McCrisken 2003 ; McEvoy-Levy 2001 ; Restad 2012 ; Walt 2011 ) .  2 While American exceptionalism be not to be understand a a “ unified body of thought , ” it be usually describe along the line of “ an unwavering belief in the uniqueness of the United States and a commitment to a providential mission to transform the rest of the world in the image of the United States ” ( Nayak and Malone 2009 , 260 ) .  Most of these study , especially contemporary one on American exceptionalism since the G .  Correspondingly , American exceptionalism be often equate with unilateralism or even exemptionalism , namely the belief that the United States be not bind by rule and norm govern the “ unexceptional rest .  Contemporary American exceptionalism have largely be read a inform by both the historical belief in America 's exceptional character since the first puritan settlement on the continent , as well a by it global superpower stand since the end of WWII ( Holsti 2010 ; McCrisken 2003 ; Onuf 2012 ) .  Regardless of whether the United States be truly unique or not , to study American exceptionalism a constitutive of US foreign policy be regard a meaningful essentially because of these two trait .  It be therefore not surprising that so far the scant IR-literature on exceptionalism in contemporary foreign policy beyond the United States have mostly start to consider Chinese exceptionalism .  Although be constantly criticize domestically for not believe in American exceptionalism , President Barack Obama have frequently refer to the United States ’ “ indispensable role ” internationally .

The main lesson that come out of this research be that we know which law work .  Despite the fact that opponent of gun regulation be say , We dont know whats go on , it mental health issue , it these crazy people , which doesnt lend itself to a solution—the truth be that we have a pretty good grasp at whats go on .  People who shouldnt have access to gun be get access .  Siegels late study , publish July 30 , 2019 , in the Journal of Rural Health , reinforce previous research find that law design to regulate who have firearm be more effective in reduce shoot than law design to control what type of gun be permit .  The study look at gun regulation state by state in comparison with FBI data about gun homicide , gather from police department around the country .  Analysis reveal that universal background check , permit requirement , may issue law ( where local authority have discretion in approve who can carry a concealed weapon ) , and law ban people convict of violent misdemeanor from possess firearm be , individually and collectively , significantly able to reduce gun-related death .  Its a particularly compelling finding because in March 2019 , Siegel and collaborator draw virtually the same conclusion by analyze state law in comparison with death certificate data collect nationally by the CDC .  In that study , which be publish March 28 , 2019 , in the Journal of General Internal Medicine , Siegels team analyze 25 year of national data to examine the relationship between 10 different type of state law and the number of death by homicide and suicide in all 50 state .  The practice of keep gun out of the hand of people who be at the great risk for violence—based on a history of violence—appears to be the most closely associate with decreased rate of firearm homicide .

***** Psychology can make important contribution to policy that prevent gun violence .  Toward this end , in February 2013 the American Psychological Association commission this report by a panel of expert to convey research-based conclusion and recommendation ( and to identify gap in such knowledge ) on how to reduce the incidence of gun violence — whether by homicide , suicide , or mass shoot — nationwide .  For this reason , there be no single profile that can reliably predict who will use a gun in a violent act .  Instead , gun violence be associate with a confluence of individual , family , school , peer , community , and sociocultural risk factor that interact over time during childhood and adolescence .  Although many youth desist in aggressive and antisocial behavior during late adolescence , others be disproportionately at risk for become involve in or otherwise affect by gun violence .  The most consistent and powerful predictor of future violence be a history of violent behavior .  Reducing incident of gun violence arise from criminal misconduct or suicide be an important goal of broad primary and secondary prevention and intervention strategy .  Such strategy must also attend to redirect developmental antecedent and large sociocultural process that contribute to gun violence and gun-related death .  Gender and Culture Any account of gun violence in the United States must be able to explain both why male be perpetrator of the vast majority of gun violence and why the vast majority of male never perpetrate gun violence .  Preliminary evidence suggest that change perception among male of social norm about behavior and characteristic associate with masculinity may reduce the prevalence of intimate partner and sexual violence .
***** In the past 12 year , several new study find that increase in the prevalence of gun ownership be associate with increase in violent crime .  Whether this association be attributable to gun prevalence cause more violent crime be unclear .  If people be more likely to acquire gun when crime rate be rise or high , then the same pattern of evidence would be expect .  An important limitation of all study in this area be the lack of direct measure of the prevalence of gun ownership .  In it 2004 review , the National Research Council ( NRC ) find that exist research study and data include a wealth of descriptive information on homicide , suicide , and firearm , but , because of the limitation of exist data and method , do not credibly demonstrate a causal relationship between the ownership of firearm and the cause or prevention of criminal violence or suicide .  Conceptually , the effect of gun prevalence on violent crime be ambiguous .  But gun prevalence may also deter would-be criminal , which could have the opposite effect on violent crime ( see the essay on education campaign and clinical intervention for promote safe storage ) .

The Environmental impact of offshore oil drilling .  La prospection pétrolière , qu ’ il s ’ agit d ’ un forage onshore ou offshore , peut causer de grandes dégradations et dommages à l ’ environnement .  Le but de cette communication est de mettre toute la lumière sur la responsabilité sociale qui entoure le forage pétrolier offshore , à travers l ’ analyse de risques environnementaux liés à cette activité , en prenant comme exemple la marée noire formée suite à l ’ explosion de la plate-forme pétrolière de BP ‘ Deepwater Horizon ’ .  This can explain the boom in offshore drill not only in the US economy , but in other county such a .
***** CBF President Will Baker address a crowd during a protest of offshore drilling .  In particular , the danger pose by offshore drilling be unacceptable .  Potential offshore drill location include the ocean water off the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay .  Offshore drilling use huge fix or float platform to extract oil and natural gas reserve from beneath the ocean .  When offshore drill be introduce into a region , it jeopardize commercial fishing , recreation , and tourist economy .
***** Here , we review the type of activity that be associate with global offshore oil and gas development in water depth over 200 m , the typical impact of these activity , some of the more extreme impact of accidental oil and gas release , and the current state of management in the major region of offshore industrial activity include 18 exclusive economic zone .  This synthesis of information provide the basis for a series of recommendation for the management of offshore oil and gas development .  , avoidance rule and marine protect area ) , and temporal measure ( e .  Potentially petroliferous offshore zone and regional distribution of proven offshore oil and gas reserve .  Numerous and varied regulation relate to the management of the hydrocarbon industry exist in different maritime jurisdiction and for area beyond national jurisdiction ( ABNJ or the Area ; Mazor et al .  Such regulation may , for example , set out the framework for environmental assessment and monitoring , define particular habitat , and/or specie that should be afford particular protection , and define the boundary of area designate for spatial management .  Here , we seek to synthesize current information on typical impact from offshore oil and gas operation and review exist management strategy and regulation in order to provide the basis for a set of recommendation for a generalized management strategy to limit environmental impact attributable to the deep-water ( 200 m ) oil and gas industry .  , spatial restriction , marine protect area ) , activity management ( i .  By the 1960s , this drilling have move into deep offshore area a easily accessible resource decline , technology for offshore drill improve , and large reserve of hydrocarbon be discover .  Currently , drill for oil and gas be routine in all offshore environment , with major deep-water ( 200 m ) production in area such a the Arctic , northern North Atlantic Ocean ( UK and Norwegian water ) , East and West Africa , Gulf of Mexico , South America , India , Southeast Asia , and Australia ( Figure 1 ) .
***** Southern Alliance for Clean Energy The debate for open up water to offshore drill within 10 mile of the Florida coast continue in full fervor .  Economists , elect official , citizen , and environmentalist warn of the danger of oil drill irreversible impact , but proponent claim that drilling for oil and gas be safe and clean .  A month later , Queenslands premier declare the 37-mile stretch of the area most popular tourist beach a disaster area .  The local tourism economy be devastate .  From the white sandy beach of Panama City to the Everglades Floridas prize coastline and related economic infrastructure just cant afford the risk of offshore drilling .
***** The deep water surprise with extraordinarily rich well , but also challenge with the difficulty relate to the offshore oil search and drilling .  The new undertaking demand the improvement of the exist oil drill technology employ for the then conventional onshore drilling and the development of new comprehensive and innovative solution for the oil industry , that would allow for safe and effective deepwater drilling .  Obviously , offshore oil drilling be a widespread thing right now , but that doesn ’ t mean that the industry still have to combat certain challenge when it come to this sphere of production .  Offshore drill allow to increase oil production With the further development of the offshore oil drilling and the increased percentage of petroleum that come from the deepwater well , the supply of oil jump up .  A lot of expert note that the increase of oil production at the expense of the deepwater drilling be a rather stimulating factor for world ’ s economy , the development of science and advanced technology .  The accident on offshore well be much more hazardous , as well a more difficult to eliminate due to the great distance between the actual oil drilling site and the emergency service ’ location .

***** Such protection produce benefit that exceed it cost in low-lying coastal area that be densely populate , a be the case for many coastal city and some small island , but in general , poor region will not be able to afford hard protection .  Avoiding new development commitment in area expose to coastal hazard and SLR also avoid additional risk .  In low-lying coastal area more broadly , human-induced change can be rapid and modify coastline over short period of time , outpace the effect of SLR ( high confidence ) .  , land reclamation ) , have a long history in most area where there be dense coastal population .  Differences from the global mean can be great than ±30 % in area of rapid vertical land movement , include those cause by local anthropogenic factor such a groundwater extraction ( high confidence ) .  However , well design coastal protection be very effective in reduce expect damage and cost efficient for urban and densely populated region , but generally unaffordable for rural and poor area ( high confidence ) .  While investment be generally cost efficient for densely populate and urban area ( high confidence ) , rural and poor area will be challenge to afford such investment with relative annual cost for some small island state amount to several percent of GDP ( high confidence ) .  Effective SLR response depend , first , on take a long-term perspective when make short-term decision , explicitly account for uncertainty of locality-specific risk beyond 2050 ( high confidence ) , and building governance capability to tackle the complexity of SLR risk ( medium evidence , high agreement ) .  At the same time coastal protection be very effective and cost-efficient for city but not for less densely populated rural area .  Additional risk relate to sea level rise ( SLR ) for low-lying coastal area by the end of the 21st century .
***** Although urban area be usually more polluted than the countryside , pollution can spread to remote place where no people live .  Mining and drilling can also contribute to water pollution .  In the 1970s , people live in the Love Canal area in Niagara Falls , New York , suffer from extremely high rate of cancer and birth defect .  It be discover that a chemical waste dump have poison the area water .  The large of these area , call the Great Pacific Garbage Patch , be in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean .

***** His answer be yes , more or less—certainly a a national ideal or policy objective , though he stress that assimilation remain an ongoing social process .  While I certainly agree with Glazer that assimilation persist a a social reality , I strongly disagree that it be dead a a national ideal or policy objective .  To be sure , assimilation be moribund among many of our elite , especially ethnic , racial , and minority group leader .  But a an animate force in our community and in our national life , assimilation be alive and well .  That Salins , an academic economist , write this book under the auspex of the Manhattan Institute and The New Republic attest to the persistence of the assimilation idea even among some of our elite .  Yet if assimilation endure a an idea , it be a very confused and muddle one .  Indeed , if Americans well understand the process of assimilation , they might well ask for something else .  This confusion be highlight by the contradictory assertion we hear about the assimilation of newcomer .
***** Studies of the pattern of economic , social and cultural integration among immigrant population suggest that religious minority with a migration background lag behind in each of these area ( example from this special issue be Shibuya , Fong , and Shu [ 2020 ] as well a Roth [ 2020 ] regard pattern of structural integration ; Kogan and Weissmann [ 2020 ] concern cultural integration ; and Beek and Fleischmann [ 2020 ] compare various dimension ) .  Regarding the former , the socioeconomic integration of immigrant youth have become a major policy concern in many immigrant-receiving country , give the high rate of unemployment among young people and the difficulty of find entry-level job .  Connor and Koenig ( 2013 ) contend that in thrive religious environment , like the US or Canada , religious attendance tend to be positively relate to occupational attainment , especially among second-generation immigrant .  On the one hand , in line with the assimilation perspective , some study have ascertain that the religious identity of immigrant youth be less salient than that of their parent ’ generation ( Fleischmann and Phalet 2012 ) .  Even among those who still identify with their minority religion , their religiosity have not be find to be closely relate to their social integration ( McAndrew and Voas 2014 ) .  in Great Britain , for example , a significant Muslim disadvantage be find among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis ( Brown 2000 ; Lindley 2002 ; Model and Lin 2002 ) , but not among Indian Muslims ( Brown 2000 ) in labour force participation and unemployment relative to white British ( Lindley 2002 ) or Christians ( Model and Lin 2002 ) .  Similar to other study in this volume , Laxer , Reitz and Simon ( 2020 ) examine the intersection of religion and origin , and provide additional insight on difference by minority ’ generation status .

A 2006 Pew Research survey find a nearly identical pattern among American Christians who be ask about a possible conflict between modernity and their own faith .  The view that there be no conflict between Islam and modernity be also much more common among college graduate than among those with less education .

European state continue to grapple with these thorny question without be able to devise a coherent response .  Indeed , a European state start their reconstruction at the end of the war , they resort to their ex-colonies to offset labour shortage .  The vast majority of these first generation migrant be young .  On the whole , these migrant contribute to the economic boom of many European state a they build road and railroad , work in the coal mine , clean street and office and , on the whole , do the job that Europeans be reluctant to do .  From that year on , European state enact law restrict regular migration but , at the same time , relax restriction of family reunification .
***** Donald Trump strike again last Tuesday with broad generalization against Muslim Americans , tell Fox News that among second- and third-generation Muslim immigrant , “ for some reason there ’ s no real assimilation .  Relying on that comparison for a complete picture of assimilation be problematic ; give rise Islamophobia that equate “ Muslim ” with “ un-American , ” the question of American identity sometimes demand impossible choice between heritage and nationality .  Reporting their find a a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research , Umut Özek of the American Institutes for Research and David Figlio of Northwestern University look at educational achievement among Latino and Asian immigrant in Florida ’ s public school .  With each generation , English language skill , wealth , and quality of education explain less and less of the achievement gap with white student whose family immigrate two generation or more back .  These find have important implication for American education ; first- and later-generation Latino and Asian immigrant — the population drive America ’ s current migration wave — be expect to make up more than a third of the population by 2050 .

AbstractThis article explore religious adaptation among immigrant-origin youth in Norway , use the first wave of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study in Norway ( CILS-NOR ) .  However , our result suggest that a process of both religious decline and religious individualization be underway among immigrant origin youth in Norway , although this process appear to unfold slow for Muslims than for non-Muslims .  The level and social form of religiosity among immigrant-origin youth be partially link to their integration in other field , particularly inter-ethnic friendship .  Classical theory of immigrant secularization and assimilation lead u to expect a post-migratory decline in religiosity , a immigrant and their child acculturate to more secular host society ( Berger [ 1969 ] 2011 ; Gordon 1964 ) .  Empirical study of religious adaptation among child of immigrant have not provide a conclusive picture of overall trend .  Some study from across Europe have find indication of religious decline among immigrant and their child ( Bisin et al .  Christians with an immigrant origin from Africa , Asia , and Latin America , on the other hand , be on average both more religious and more rule orient and exclusivist in their religious belief , even if they adhere to the same religion .
***** Often , these young people have never formally learn about Islam , either because their parent stress the importance of assimilation or because they believe their child would pick up the tradition in the same way they do a child in North Africa .  Souad ( last name not give ) be part of this generation .  They saw that my work do not change , even get good , and one say , if anyone criticize you let me know and I will take care of it .
***** A new generation of cathedral mosque have bring Islam out of Muslim district into the public arena .  Of the three generation that have grow up since Muslims arrive in the West in the 20th century , the third be the most stridently oppose to government interference , be it foreign or Western , and to jihadist propaganda .  ” Though German official , among others , have cut off dialogue , a new generation of Salafists be experiment with great openness .  “ While old-school Salafists be argue over the minutia of Islamic law , their child be debate whether or not God even exist , ” he add .
***** US Census data from 1920 reveals that recent immigrant give their child more foreign name than long-standing immigrant , which suggest that cultural assimilation do take place over time .  This assimilation have economic benefit for child , both in school and in the labour market .  2 Speaking of Muslim immigrant , Trump lament that “ [ f ] or some reason , there ’ s no real assimilation .  I ’ m talk about second and third generation .  In recent work with our co-author Katherine Eriksson , we study the cultural assimilation of immigrant during the Age of Mass Migration ( 1850-1913 ) , during which 30 million migrant move from Europe to the US ( Abramitzky et al .  We trace out a ‘ cultural assimilation profile ’ with time spend in the US , use change in the foreignness of name that immigrant parent select for their child a a measure of cultural adaptation .

On subsidies for ethanol production.
***** ” His proposal , fortunately , didn ’ t get much far than a small subsidy for corn ethanol .  Just a few year later , with it market share under assault from new non-OPEC oil producer , Saudi Arabia suddenly double production .  As a way to replace dwindle reserve of oil , ethanol subsidy have a certain brutal logic , especially if oil price be go to keep rise with no end in sight .  Corn ethanol may well be bad for the climate than fossil fuel , and the program do significant damage to both the economy and the environment .  Mysterious glow clam could help save the planet Corn ethanol be the mainstay of the nation ’ s Renewable Fuel Standard , which be create in 2005 when gasoline price finally rise again , though that price shock , too , prove fleeting .  The RFS create a complex web of target for both corn ethanol and “ advance biofuels .
***** Corn Ethanol and Other Corn-Based Biofuels SubsidiesTaxpayers have subsidize the mature corn ethanol industry for more than 40 year Since the creation of the domestic market for corn ethanol after the energy crisis of the 1970s , the federal government have nurture and maintain the ethanol industry with a steady stream of subsidy .  Originally sell a a way to achieve energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission , ethanol have be a favorite of policymakers from the Corn Belt .  The large current subsidy for corn ethanol be the federal Renewable Fuel Standard ( RFS ) mandate , administer by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .

***** SubscribeDONATECONTACTSEARCH Since it creation of the domestic market for corn ethanol after the energy crisis of the 1970s , the federal government have nurture and maintain the ethanol industry with a steady stream of subsidy .  Originally sell a a way to achieve energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emission , ethanol have be a favorite of many lawmaker .  ethanol producer have receive favorable treatment under the tax code , tariff protection from foreign competition , and even a government mandate for it use .  As a result , taxpayer have spend billion of dollar over the last 30 year subsidize the production of corn ethanol , while at the same time create unintended cost for consumer and the environment .  To start , the farm bill , a massive piece of legislation cover topic range from nutrition assistance to broadband internet , provide government subsidy for the now-mature ethanol industry , include corporate agribusiness giant such a Archer Daniels Midland .  The majority of support for corn ethanol in the farm bill come from energy title program such a the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels , trade program such a the Market Access Program , and other commodity and crop insurance support for corn and ethanol blender pump .  While the Rural Energy for America Program also provide subsidy for ethanol blender pump begin in 2011 , such support be prohibit in the 2014 farm bill .  In May 2015 , however , USDA once again announcedadditional support for blender pump through the Commodity Credit Corporation , a fund typically reserve for farm loan and other major farm subsidy program .
***** The primary ethanol subsidy offer by the federal government be a tax incentive call the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit , which be pass by Congress and sign into law by President George W .  The ethanol subsidy , which be commonly refer to a the `` blender 's credit , `` offer ethanol blender register with the Internal Revenue Service a tax credit of 45 cent for every gallon of pure ethanol they blend with gasoline .  That particular ethanol subsidy cost taxpayer $ 5 .  Debate Over the Ethanol Subsidy Supporters of the federal ethanol subsidy argue that it encourage production and use of the biofuel and thereby reduce the amount of foreign oil need to produce gasoline , a step toward energy independence .  But critic argue that ethanol burn far less efficiently than gasoline , drive up fuel consumption and that it increase demand for corn for fuel and artificially boost the cost of farm commodity and retail price of food .  They also say such an incentive be unnecessary because legislation enact in 2007 require oil company to produce 36 billion gallon of biofuels such a ethanol by 2022 .
***** Fraser Institute Its difficult to fault the motif of those on either side of the ethanol divide .  Most ethanol critic be genuinely concern about divert croplands from food to fuel and the cascade effect this have on the economy and the environment .  Many worry about the subsidy that be fuel the ethanol boom .  Most ethanol enthusiast , on the other hand , be motivate by a sincere desire to provide relief at the gas pump and help the US expand it energy option .  Many believe that ethanol offer a green alternative to fossil fuel .  Washingtons bear-hug embrace of ethanol be change Americas landscapefiguratively and literally .  Watering the PlantsIn the United States , 95 percent of ethanol be derive from corn .
***** The prime focus of ethanol production from corn be to replace the import oil use in American vehicle , without expend more fossil energy in ethanol production than be produce a ethanol energy .  In a thorough and up-to-date evaluation of all the fossil energy cost of ethanol production from corn , every step in the production and conversion process must be include .  43 kcal fossil energy be expend to produce 1 kcal ethanol .  When the energy value of the DDG , base on the feed value of the DDG a compare to that of soybean meal , be consider , the energy cost of ethanol production be reduce slightly , to 1 .  28 kcal fossil energy input per 1 kcal ethanol produce .
***** 1641/B580718 Abstract This article explain why we be experience a boom in ethanol and other biofuels , the current status of biofuels , and prospect for the future under different policy regime .  I argue that today 's boom be in a sense an unintended consequence of a fixed ethanol subsidy that be key to $ 20-per-barrel crude oil , combine with a surge in crude oil prices—initially to $ 60 per barrel , and later double to $ 120 per barrel .  Future prospect for corn ethanol depend on the crude oil price , the price of corn and distiller ' grain , the market value of ethanol , plant capital and operating cost , and federal ethanol and biofuels policy .  Between 1978 and today , the ethanol subsidy have range between 10 .  The subsidy mechanism originally be a partial excise-tax exemption for the blended fuel , whereas now it be a tax credit for the entity that blend ethanol with gasoline .  Throughout the almost three-decade history of ethanol production , the subsidy have be a fixed amount , invariant with oil or corn price ( Tyner and Quear 2006 ) .

In fact , Koplow ( 2006 ) calculate the total subsidy available for ethanol in 2006 to range between 27 .  5 cent per liter of ethanol ( $ 1 .  Many would regard these figure as high , but they do demonstrate that the ethanol industry have be one with substantial subsidy .

With increase supply of ethanol , Gadkari say the government plan to introduce flex fuel engine vehicle in the country .  With the rollout of flex-fuel vehicle on 100 per cent bio-ethanol , the demand for ethanol will immediately jump by 4 to 5 time , he add .  The minister also ask sugar mill to set up their own ethanol pump , which be be permit by the government .  So , that can increase the demand of ethanol in Indian market , `` Gadkari say .

This debate over budget and deficit be about more than just number on a page ; it 's about more than just cut and spending .  `` There but for the grace of God go I , `` we say to ourselves .  To meet this challenge , our leader come together three time during the 1990s to reduce our nation 's deficit — three time .  We go from deficit to surplus .

In another tweet , Trump say the defense legislation must , among other thing , `` preserve our National Monuments .  The White House press office and the Office of Management and Budget would not say whether Trump would issue a veto threat on the omnibus if it include Confederate imagery prohibition in the Interior-Environment title .  There be increase suspicion among some congressional aide that Democrats might let it go this time , restrict for now their fight against memorialize the Confederacy to the NDAA — a `` must-pass `` measure that almost always pass with strong bipartisan support , unlike an omnibus that can alienate fiscal conservative .

***** No cheer , applause , boo , hiss — among other noisy distract thing — so we may all concentrate on what the candidate have to say .  Governor Romney have a perspective that say if we cut tax , skew towards the wealthy , and roll back regulation that we 'll be good off .  I think it 's important for u to develop new source of energy here in America , that we change our tax code to make sure that we 're help small business and company that be invest here in the United States , that we take some of the money that we 're save a we wind down two war to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allow u to make these critical investment .  Are we go to double down on the top-down economic policy that help to get u into this mess , or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that say , America do best when the middle class do best ? .  I be in Dayton , Ohio , and a woman grab my arm , and she say , I 've be out of work since May .  Ann yesterday be a rally in Denver , and a woman come up to her with a baby in her arm and say , Ann , my husband have have four job in three year , part-time job .  And the answer be yes , we can help , but it 's go to take a different path , not the one we 've be on , not the one the president describe a a top-down , cut tax for the rich .  President , please respond directly to what the governor just say about trickle-down — his trickle-down approach .  He 's — a he say yours be .  Now , in order for u to do it , we do have to close our deficit , and one of the thing I 'm sure we 'll be discuss tonight be , how do we deal with our tax code , and how do we make sure that we be reduce spending in a responsible way , but also how do we have enough revenue to make those investment ? .  How we pay for that , reduce the deficit and make the investment that we need to make without dump those cost on the middle-class Americans I think be one of the central question of this campaign .
***** The White House versus Republican leader over the deficit and debt ceiling .  SUSAN PAGEJoining me in the studio to talk about the late proposal and the chance for an agreement or a default , Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute , Alice Rivlin of the Brookings Institution and Sudeep Reddy of The Wall Street Journal .  Reid 's proposal identify $ 2 .  And those cut have already be agree to in the bipartisan negotiation that the vice president be run .  34PAGESo do you think that proposal by Sen .  The veto statement that the White House put out yesterday do not say that the president would veto the Boehner plan if it come to his desk .  It say that his senior adviser would advise him to veto it if it come there .  You know , all you need to do be look at what S & P , Standard & Poor , say this morning , that a short-term extension be not good for the economy and be likely go to lead to a downgrade .
***** We don ` t know what John Boehner say to the president on the phone today , but we do know that Boehner be finally admit defeat on one thing .  Also , this afternoon , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner say this on CNBC .  If Congress in any way suggest that they ` re go to tie negotiation to debt ceiling vote and take u to the brink of default once again , a part of a budget negotiation , which , by the way , we have never do in our history until we do this it last year -- I will not play that game .  If the president doesn ` t agree with our proposal and our outline , I think he ` s get an obligation to send one to the Congress , a plan that can pass both chamber of Congress .  There be nothing , nothing could be more clear that this administration mean what they say about get what they want at this point .  But we ` re not go to get out of this deficit problem , we must raise tax across the board , to go back to what Bill Clinton have in his tax .  You know , I think part of what you have to look at here be it ` s really Republicans who force this conversation about have deficit reduction right now .  We shouldn ` t have deficit reduction right now .
***** The organic law that establish the Treasury Department in 1789 specifically say that it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to digest and prepare plan for the improvement and management of the revenue and for the support of the public credit .  Now , the President say this be tantamount to a family say it would make it house payment , but not it car payment .  Principled dispute over how the debt limit be address be go to happen from time to time .  Chairman , I just want to start out by say that I think we can find bipartisan consensus on what you say at the beginning , that Wisconsin be the great State .  I think it be important that we should note the Federal deficit have decline under President Obama by two-thirds since he come into office , and that be extremely significant and part of what we be look at .  In fact , this year the CBO have predict the Federal deficit will increase very slightly after 6 consecutive year of decline , and that be due to our action , what we do in December with the omnibus bill .  And a of October last year , a a percentage of the economy , the deficit be now down to 2\1/2\ percent , which be below the average of the past half-century , and it be down about 9 .  The second thing I just want to put out there for u to consider be the Simpson-Bowles Act that be out there , the proposal about how to try to provide relief -- I know that I be n't around ; this be only my second term .  I saw what happen across the country when we lose billion of dollar out of the economy , when it affect small business and the decision-making they be go to make .  And the problem be that we have n't be do that part of our job very well , so then this become a proposal that we need to look at .
***** But everyone -- that I have speak with believe that your plan have the most credible way to actually get our arm around -- around the debt and deficit of this country .  So Senator , let me ask you , because earlier this week , you say basically , `` Do n't count on a fiscal deal -- before automatic spending cut and the tax hike take effect on New Year 's Day .  So wh -- why do you -- why do you differ in term of what the president say yesterday ? .  And what we say be , `` Look , let 's start by wipe out all of those .  Let 's use 92 % of that money that we 're usin ' from get ' rid of the tax expenditures to reduce income tax rate and 8 % of the money or about $ 100 billion a year to reduce the deficit .  Eight -- $ 100 billion a year over ten year be where our $ 1 trillion of our $ 4 trillion come from in our deficit reduction plan .
***** budget deficit take center stage a Congress reconvenes and two outside commission develop recommendation for action .  Suddenly the budget world will be awash in comprehensive plan to reduce deficit and stabilize the debt .  Sawhill , Senior Fellow and Director , Budgeting for National Priorities The co-chairs of the president ’ s fiscal commission have put forward a strong and interesting set of proposal ( pdf ) to reduce an absolutely frightening accumulation of debt over the next decade and beyond .  a focus on “ cut but invest ” in education , infrastructure and research ; a sensitivity to raise revenue and cut benefit in a way that protect the less advantaged and ask the wealthy to sacrifice more ; a willingness to tackle many sacred cow from agricultural subsidy to the mortgage interest deduction ; and a bold proposal to radically simplify the tax system by eliminate or limit deduction and other special preference .  But critic of the proposal , from Nancy Pelosi to Grover Nordquist , be live in an Alice in Wonderland world in which it be assume we can go on borrow money from other country indefinitely with little or no consequence for the constituency they represent .  If the critic don ’ t like what the chairman have propose , the only responsible thing to do be to suggest an alternative that accomplish roughly the same deficit reduction goal .
***** “ This time it really be different , ” say Steve Bell , senior director of economic policy at the influential Bipartisan Policy Center , who spend 30 year work for Republicans in Congress .

The backup to the backup planJust a Boehner and his team begin sell the emerge deal , the Gang of Six go rogue .  The release of that proposal change the strategy for Obama .
***** I say I will fight for Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid because these be thing that matter .  As weve say here repeatedly , America doesnt face a Medicare crisis we face a national health care crisis .  In spite of this , Congress appear ready to protect that broken health care market that be wreck our economy in favor of target the program that work for cut all in the name of deficit reduction .  Kudos to Nancy Cook at the National Journal for look beyond the news release headline and doom-and-gloom sound bite offer by the billion dollar anti-Social Security and Medicare lobby in Washington in her coverage of the deficit debate .  Fiscal Commission chairman Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson , lead their corporate-backed Fix the Debt campaign , certainly get plenty of attention this week for repackaging their plan to cut benefit to million of middle-class American in Social Security and Medicare , veteran , people with disability and more to cut the deficit .  Thankfully , Cook provide the desperately need analysis and perspective miss in most of the main stream medium coverage on why these men continue to push for deficit reduction on the back of average Americansespecially now that many these same family be finally start to see a dim light at the end of a long recessionary tunnel .  The deficit be go down , health care cost growth be slow and the economy be finally show sign of recovery .  Deficit reduction isnt the big challenge face our nation in spite of year of doom-and-gloom prognostication from this well-financed anti-entitlement lobby .

It be not surprising that David Brooks would criticize Coates for fail to consider how individual choice informs outcome , but Coates ’ s tendency to reduce all system of inequality to a one size fit all racism leave him susceptible to this type of critique .  Ta-Nehisi Coates ’ s major work on race and American politics — “ The Case for Reparations , ” “ The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration , ” “ My President Was Black , ” and “ The First White President ” — contend that liberal social policy have fail African Americans since the New Deal because progressive have tend to view “ racism not a an active , distinct evil but a a relative of white poverty and inequality .  ” 1 According to Coates , the New Deal enshrine into law a system of entrenched inequity , via discriminatory Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) mortgage policy , that plunder black body and engendered ghettoization ; the Johnson administration ignore the urging of Assistant Labor Secretary Daniel Patrick Moynihan to forge a War on Poverty center on the distinctiveness of black poverty , thereby pave the way for mass incarceration ; affirmative action ’ s promise to close the material divide between black and white remain unfulfilled , thanks to it scattered focus on diversity and inclusion ; and Obama ’ s predilection for “ universal ” program — such a the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , expansion of Pell Grants , and the Earned Income Tax Credit — fail to ignite a progressive , class-based coalition capable of stave off a racist , populist Trump political insurgency .  The War on Poverty do fail to address the root cause of black poverty , and this failure have certainly contribute to contemporary disparity in incarceration rate .  Drawing on the work of political scientist Ira Katznelson , Coates ultimately attribute the exclusion of agricultural and domestic worker — “ job heavily occupy by black ” — from the Social Security Act to southern Democrats ’ desire to infuse Jim Crow into federal policy .  This be why program like Job Corps and Community Action Programs emphasize provision of job training and cultural tutelage to impoverish minority youth rather than public work .

***** In assert that the Boeing Company be engage in unfair labor practice by establish a new aircraft assembly facility in South Carolina , a right-to-work state , instead of Washington State , which be heavily unionized , the National Labor Relations Board be twist the law to benefit union at the expense of the rule of law and the nation ’ s economy .  If allow to stand , it action threaten business investment and job creation as well a the employment of both unionized and nonunion worker .  Congress should amend the National Labor Relations Act to reaffirm the long-standing construction of the Act that any new investment decisions—such a ( but not limited to ) expand exist facility , build new plant , or relocating—are not unfair labor practice and be outside the legal jurisdiction of an overzealous NLRB .  The federal government do not have the legal authority to prohibit a company from expand it business or building a new factory in another state .  To prevent any more litigation cost and anti-competitive pressure , Congress should amend the National Labor Relations Act ( NLRA ) to reaffirm the long-standing construction of the Act that any new investment decisions—such a ( but not limited to ) expand exist facility , build new plant , or relocating—are not unfair labor practice and be outside the legal jurisdiction of an overzealous NLRB .

[ 10 ] Unmentioned in the complaint be the reported $ 900 million incentive package give to Boeing by the state of South Carolina .  Just because a Boeing executive say that one of “ the override factor [ s ] ” in move the work to a factory in South Carolina be “ that [ Boeing ] can not afford to have a work stoppage…every three year ” be not indicative of anti-union animus ; it be a statement of “ demonstrably probable ” economic effect .  ” [ 22 ] In this case , Boeing be not even try to obtain an advantage in it bargain position with the union , an objective the Supreme Court have say be lawful .  [ 23 ] Furthermore , Boeing ’ s action can hardly be consider a “ reprisal ” against a union when none of the job hold by the union ’ s member have be eliminate since the company decide to build a South Carolina factory .

***** 2021 The United States ’ dependence on oil have long influence it foreign policy .  oil development , and the result geopolitical competition and environmental concern , in more than forty milestone .  The three major period include the rise of oil a a commodity , begin in 1850 ; the post-WWII age of geopolitical competition ; and the current era of deregulation and diversification .  An oil well near Titusville , Pennsylvania , four year after Col .  Drake strike oil on August 27 , 1859 .  In the mid-1800s , kerosene produce from refine crude oil begin to make it way onto the market in the United States a a lighting fuel , an alternative to the dwindle supply of whale oil .  Crude oil be successfully extract use a new drilling method in Pennsylvania , which spark a regional influx of speculative oil drilling .  oil refinery come online in 1861 , and the United States export it first shipment of refined oil to London .  Over the next century and a half , oil supplants coal a the country ’ s preeminent fuel source and contribute to it emergence a a major economic power .  In 1880 , the United States be responsible for 85 percent of the world ’ s crude oil production and refining , and kerosene be the fourth large U .  dominance of European and Asian oil market be challenge by new oil find control by Great Britain , the Netherlands , and Russia .  Still , over the next two decade , major oil find in state such a California , Oklahoma , and Texas help increase U .
***** Now , the President 's supporter like to say , and they be correct , that oil production be up in the U .  In fact , oil production be down on Federal land , and that be what the President have control of .  In fact , one of the President 's first initiative in 2009 be to cancel oil lease on Federal land and to delay the offshore leasing program , and he cancel five offshore lease even before the Horizon -- Deepwater Horizon incident .  So rather than try to reduce the cost of exist regulation by EPA , they be consider add more regulation , such a new source performance standard target greenhouse gas emission from refinery and new Tier 3 regulation .  Commissioner Chilton estimate that Wall Street speculator raise the price an additional $ 7 to $ 14 every time a consumer fill up the tank , depend on the size of the car While industry group dispute these figure , I think it would behoove u all to shed some light on this issue in order to bring transparency and help the American consumer well understand this relationship between the speculator and rise fuel price and raise fuel price also .  And while some may argue that rise fuel price be simply a matter of supply and demand , today 's sharp increase be happen at a time when under President Obama we be produce more oil than at any time in our history .  We be import less oil than at any time in the past 13 year , and the American demand for oil be actually low than it be a year ago .  An article by `` The Washington Post `` with Bloomberg Business entitle gas price rise for the 27th straight day , oil recovers late to close above $ 107 a barrel , date February 29 , 2012 , Washington Post and Bloomberg business both report that Americans be pay an average of $ 3 .  None of America 's pain at the pump should be self-inflicted , which be why we need to do more to increase domestic and North American oil supply , and to streamline the Federal regulatory burden on At last weekend in my district , gas price average 3 .  85 a gallon back then , and one of the President 's first initiative before Deepwater Horizon be to cancel many of the oil lease on Federal land .  claim that produce more domestic oil wo n't make any difference in price , but the American people know well .  That be why we need to repeal the oil subsidy and use the money to develop source of clean energy that reduce our dependence on oil .  produce a majority of it oil , but because oil be price on the global market lead by the OPEC cartel , more production here do not lower price and grow worldwide demand can offset our low consumption .
***** Today I 'd like to draw attention to a little known video from 2010 , which show a top EPA official , Region VI Administrator Al Armendariz , use the vivid metaphor of crucifixion to explain EPA 's enforcement tactic for oil and gas producer .  In this video Administrator Armendariz say , `` But a I say , oil and gas be an enforcement priority , it 's one of seven , so we be go to spend a fair amount of time look at oil and gas production .  So you go out , you look at an industry , you find people violate the law , you go aggressively after them .  So you put some financial pressure on a company , you get other people in that industry to clean up very quickly .  His comment give u a rare glimpse into the Obama administration 's true agenda ; no matter how much President Obama may pretend to be a friend of oil and natural gas , his green team constantly betray the truth that the Obama Administration be fully engage in an all out war on hydraulic fracturing , and indeed all fossil fuel .  The ultimate goal of these effort be , of course , to strip state of their traditional authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing and seize bureaucratic control over unconventional oil and gas development across this country .
***** It make you realize , Lovell would say , just what you have back there on Earth .  In fact , those who be already feel the effect of climate change dont have time to deny ittheyre busy deal with it .  For the first time in 18 year , America be poise to produce more of our own oil than we buy from other nation .  So today , for the sake of our child , and the health and safety of all Americans , Im direct the Environmental Protection Agency to put an end to the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plant , and complete new pollution standard for both new and exist power plant .  And the reason I know youll hear those thing be because thats what they say every time America set clear rule and good standard for our air and our water and our childrens health .
***** The United States ’ reliance on oil have grow since the inception of industrialization .  In the 21st century , however , reliance on energy have shift dramatically from a simple need to fuel economic growth to a complex landscape in which oil extraction be entangle with narrative of national security , international relation , energy independence , and climate change .  Even more complex than the narrative oil be relate to be what oil drive .  In this article , I argue that characterization of oil a an essential service during the COVID-19 pandemic be reminiscent of the way in which oil have be characterize a critical to energy security .  These present-day rhetorical characterization serve to justify the continued subsidization and potential bailout of the oil industry during the COVID-19 pandemic , despite the reality of crash demand and historically low oil price .  In favor the essential service narrative over the reality of the oil industry and it relationship to rapidly accelerate climate change , I contend that the opportunity that low demand and price offer for stimulate the transition to zero and low-carbon emission energy source in the United States be be ignore .  Oil , Energy Security , and Securitization Theory In the United States , presidential administration since the early 2000s have combat concern about oil in the United States by frame the issue a one of energy security .  Indeed , the multiple energy crisis withstand since the 1970s have be key to frame oil production a critical to energy security across the United States .  In 1912 when Britain convert it warship fleet from coal to oil , the issue be frame a one of energy security .  The term energy security be later coin in 1956 during the Suez Crisis in which oil supply be unstable .  Further oil supply instability in the 1970s due to the Yom Kippur War and the Iranian Revolution advance the issue of energy security , orient it a a term refer to a stable supply of energy… against geopolitical risk .
***** The revamped fleet , he proclaim , should be fuel with oil , rather than coal—a decision that continue to reverberate in the present .  Burning a pound of fuel oil produce about twice as much energy a burn a pound of coal .  Because of this great energy density , oil could push ship faster and farther than coal could .  The United Kingdom have lot of coal but next to no oil .  The solution , Churchill tell Parliament in 1913 , be for Britons to become “ the owner , or at any rate , the controller at the source of at least a proportion of the supply of natural oil which we require .  soon buy 51 percent of what be now British Petroleum , which have right to oil “ at the source ” .  Churchill fire the start gun , but all of the Western power join the race to control Middle Eastern oil .  Britain claw past France , Germany , and the Netherlands , only to be overtake by the United States , which secure oil concession in Turkey , Iraq , Bahrain , Kuwait , and Saudi Arabia .  Even a oil-consuming nation intervene in the affair of oil-producing nation , they seethe at their powerlessness ; oil producer exact huge sum from oil consumer but chafe at have to submit to them .  All of this be call into question by the voyage of the Chikyu ( “ Earth ” ) , a $ 540 million Japanese deep-sea drilling vessel that look like a billionaire ’ s yacht with a 30-story oil derrick screw into it back .  try to develop an energy source that could free not just Japan but much of the world from the dependence on Middle Eastern oil that have bedevil politician since Churchill ’ s day .  ” Petroleum have wreak all kind of social and environmental havoc , but a steady supply of oil and gas remain just a central to the world ’ s economic well-being a it be in Churchill ’ s day .

***** For five year , the coal industry and it fossil-fueled ally in the Republican Party have accuse the Obama Administration of wag a war on coal .  They claim the administration new plan to limit carbon emission at exist power plant be really about carbon emission at exist coal plant .  When Obama say Saturday that his carbon rule will prevent 100,000 asthma attack in Year One , he wasnt describe the health benefit of emit le carbon dioxide ; he be describe the health benefit of burn le coal .

White men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes.
***** Violent crime be down in New York and many other city , but there be two big reason to keep the champagne cork .  Worse , though policing and prison policy matter , nothing affect crime rate more than the number of young male in the population—and by the year 2010 , there will be about 4 .  8 percent more white and 26 percent more black .  Since around 6 percent of young male turn out to be career criminal , accord to the historical data , this increase will put an estimated 270,000 more young predator on the street than in 1990 , come at u in wave over the next two decade .  Numerous study show that each succeed generation of young male criminal commits about three time a much serious crime a the one before it .  The second reason to keep the champagne cork be that not only be the number of young black criminal likely to surge , but also the black crime rate , both black-on-black and black-on-white , be increase , so that as many a half of these juvenile super-predators could be young black male .  But just when we need to think most earnestly about black crime , the space for honest discourse about race and crime be shrink .  verdict and it racially polarize aftermath , in the utter certitude of many black that the justice system be rig against them , in the belief of many white that violent crime be synonymous with black crime and the fear they feel of every young black male passerby not wear a tie or handcuff .

If black be overrepresented in the rank of the imprisoned , it be because black be overrepresented in the criminal ranks—and the violent criminal rank , at that .  These small difference be explain by the fact that black violent crime be generally more serious than white one ( aggravate rather than simple assault , weapon-related crime rather than weaponless one ) .  We be find that the imprisoned “ drug offender , ” black and white , like most of the rest of the sample , have commit many time more property , drug , and violent crime than the late entry on their prison rap sheet would indicate .

***** Racial Bias and Disparities in Proactive Policing The high rate at which non-Whites be stop , question , cite , arrest , or injure by the police present some of the most salient criminal justice policy phenomenon in the United States ( Kochel , Wilson , and Mastrofski , 2011 ; Lytle , 2014 ) .  For example , researcher have be study differential stop and arrest rate across demographic groupsand more generally , racial disparity in criminal justice involvement , offend , and the likelihood of become a crime victimfor several decade ( see , e .  For example , if in a certain community , Black people experience great level of poverty than White people and per caput , Black people be arrest more frequently for violent crime than White people , then these would be racial disparity in poverty and in arrest rate for violent crime .  For example , Black people may be arrest more frequently in part because they experience great poverty .  An officer may knowingly dislike Latino people or may consciously believe that Black people commit more crime .  Indeed , many police department across the country collect data on officer-citizen interaction , include characteristic of the individual stop such a race , ethnicity , gender , and age ; consequence of the interaction whether it be a citation , arrest , or a warning ; information on whether the individual be search ; and in some instance the consequence of search .  Using these incident-level data , it be easy to tabulate the racial composition of those stop , search , arrest , cite , and so on .  For example , in Harcourts ( 2007 ) review of this research , the author note study of Maryland in the late 1990s where Blacks comprise 63 percent of all stop along Interstate 95 , a study in Missouri in 2001 where Blacks and Latinos account for 75 percent of stop , and a study of Volusia County , Florida , where non-Whites account for 70 percent of stop and 80 percent of search along Interstate 95 .  One might argue that those at risk be those who be arrest by the police , make the race of the arrested population the relevant benchmark .  However , differential arrest rate across race may reflect geographic difference in enforcement or racial bias in arrest decision of law enforcement .

Keynes felt that the market economy would go to excess , and when thing be in difficulty the market would n't work .  Hayek felt that the market would eventually take care of itself .  Keynes describe this global market in which trade flow freely .  He be also a familiar figure in the City of London , where he make a fortune in the stock market , lose it all , and make it back again .  Keynes felt the reparation be out of all proportion to what an economy could really take and would have very destructive social , political , and economic consequence .  He openly say that he at one time be a socialist of the mild sort , where concern for the poor and concern for fairness and equity would help to determine government policy .  Von Mises believe market , like people , need to be free from government meddling .  The distinguish hallmark of the Austrian school of economic thought be that market work and government do n't .  What von Mises say be that the great flaw of socialism be that it do n't have a functioning price system to send all the signal to consumer and producer a to what something be worth ; that these price be at the very heart of what make a function economy work .  What be at stake in our economic decision today be not some grand warfare of rival ideology which will sweep the country with passion , but the practical management of a modern economy .

Today , in the second decade of the 21st century , we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion , ” he say .  If there be ever a moment where we have to effectively analyze the compete political and social force which define this historical period , this be that time .  If there be ever a moment when we need to stand up and fight against the force of oligarchy and authoritarianism , this be that time .  Even while macroeconomic number like GDP , the stock market and the unemployment rate be strong , million of middle class and work people struggle to keep their head above water , while the billionaire class consume the lion ’ s share of the wealth that we be collectively create a a nation .  And despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity , the average wage of the American worker in real dollar be no high than it be 46 year ago and million of people be force to work two or three job just to survive .  In other word , the issue of unfettered capitalism be not just an academic debate , poverty , economic distress and despair be life-threatening issue for million of work people in the country .
***** Donohue say little , but he didnt have to .  Economists , policymakers , and everyday Americans alike generally accept that market , unfettered and free , be the best way to create economic growth .  Its not just the fringe question free market orthodoxy in a time of disease .  The new manage market paradigm be big than Bidenomics or any particular economic agendait be a story about how the economy work .  We go from living in a country where market couldnt be touch to one where Americans believe the state have an important role in manage them to create prosperity .  What kill off free market mythology , and what will come next ? .  * * * A crisis in confidence in government trigger the last paradigm shift , make way for the rise of free market thinking .  government create our problem , and market will solve them .  These free market advocate have be prepare for decade .  As wage stagnate and the cost of live soar , the promise of the free market be start to look suspicious .
***** The diverse condition of historical era , and differ ideology of America 's people , give rise to various political party , find to advance specific ideal and the candidate who represent them .

***** The erosion of press freedom be both a symptom of and a contributor to the breakdown of other democratic institution and principle , a fact that make it especially alarm .  The basic desire for democratic liberty , include access to honest and fact-based journalism , can never be extinguish , and it be never too late to renew the demand that these right be grant in full .  The problem have arise in tandem with right-wing populism , which have undermine basic freedom in many democratic country .  Populist leader present themselves a the defender of an aggrieved majority against liberal elite and ethnic minority whose loyalty they question , and argue that the interest of the nation—as they define it—should override democratic principle like press freedom , transparency , and open debate .  Viktor Orbán ’ s government in Hungary and Aleksandar Vučić ’ s administration in Serbia have have great success in snuff out critical journalism , blaze a trail for populist force elsewhere .  In perhaps the most concerning development of recent year , press freedom have come under unusual pressure in the United States , the world ’ s lead democratic power .  Partly Free country be almost equally likely to experience a gain a a decline in press freedom , reflect the volatility of these middle performer and the complex force influence their trajectory .  But the average score in the two least free region of the world , Eurasia and the Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) , decline by 9 percent and 11 percent , respectively , while press freedom in Europe—where four out of every five country be Free—dropped by 8 percent .
***** Instead we must dip deep into often-untapped well of our democratic tradition to fight the imperialist strain and plutocratic impulse in American life .  We must not allow our elect officials�many beholden to unaccountable corporate elites�to bastardize and pulverize the precious word democracy a they fail to respect and act on genuine democratic ideal .  These three dogma , promote by the most powerful force in our world , be render American democracy vacuous .  The first dogma of free-market fundamentalism posit the unregulated and unfettered market a idol and fetish .  This glorification of the market have lead to a callous corporate-dominated political economy in which business leader ( their wealth and power ) be to be worshipped�even despite the recent scandals�and the most powerful corporation be delegate magical power of salvation rather than relegate to democratic scrutiny concern both the ethic of their business practice and their treatment of worker .  The fundamentalism of the market put a premium on the activity of buy and selling , consume and take , promote and advertising , and devalues community , compassionate charity , and improvement of the general quality of life .
***** In Giulianis case , of course , it a device to appeal to the GOP voter base , where the NBC/Wall Street Journal find the comfort level with a potential Clinton presidency at 14 percent , well behind other Democratic candidate .  In the GOP debate in Michigan , the second sentence out of Giulianis mouth be and the lead Democratic candidate once say that the unfettered free market be the most destructive force in modern America .  ( The Clinton campaign declare in response that Rudy get it wrong and cite a Clinton appearance on C-SPAN in which she say she believe that unfettered capitalism be the most radically disruptive force in American life .  She add , the market be the drive force behind our prosperity , our freedom but it can not be permit to run roughshod over people life as well .  So far , the presidential race story be that Clinton be sweep on the Democratic side now lead nationally by 22 point , with all constituency group , in all the poll primary and caucus state , now include Iowa , as well a on most leadership attribute , a the candidate Democrats believe most likely to win , and also in the late fund-raising sweepstakes .
***** His trenchant account , under the head of “ polyarchy , ” of basic democracy , of the further criterion for full democracy , and of the condition for achieve democracy at both these level have establish the current standard for discuss democratic theory .  The fundamental political problem that preoccupy Dahl a a philosopher ( and a an empirical political scientist a well ) be the difficulty of self-governance in a complex , populous modern society .  The democracy of today , to stay relevant and effective , must cope not only with the reality of enormously populous society and with social pluralism inside and outside national boundary , but also with a globalize modern market economy .  However , Dahl do not turn away from the past of democracy and democratic philosophy .  SIZE , PLURALISM , AN INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY Three grand complication for democracy in modern society arise from the large size of the society in almost every national state ( not only there ) ; from the various pluralistic aspect of the society in each case ; and from the presence and growth of an industrial economy , in which a good deal of economic and political power be exercise by the executive of private corporation .  Dahl accept that a citizen in a complex , populous , modern society must renounce some personal influence ( on the national scene , just about all of it ) to have a government that be effective in deal with macropolitical issue .  Unfortunately , though he pose the question , he have little if anything to say about the interunit rule .  Once again , we do best to think of the discussion of size offer in Toward Democracy , even in the substantial section devote to them , a more an effort to place question firmly on the agenda of democratic theory than an effort to answer the question .
***** April 14 , 2016 At the Democratic debate , in an energetic exchange on the minimum wage during which both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders raise their voice , Sanders wrap up his argument by say .  Implacable may also be use in reference to something that be inexorable , a when Vladimir Nabokov write in his novel The Defense , `` By an implacable repetition of move it be lead once more to that same passion which would destroy the dream of life .  “ They be not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncement but they ’ re rattle by him , and for good reason , ” Obama say .  `` The fact be , the medium love controversy , the medium love to pay attention to this stuff and to work it up , `` Christie say .  Eight year ago to the day , in a concession speech follow her loss to President Obama in the 2008 primary , Clinton say .  ” Without name the Republican candidate , Obama preface his remark by say “ maybe somebody can pull up in a dictionary quickly , the phrase populism .  ” He then go on to mention his desire to help child , the poor , and worker have equal and fair access to opportunity , say .

***** They think that if we simply eliminate protection for family and consumer , let Wall Street write it own rule again , and cut tax for the wealthy , the market will solve all our problem on it own .  Their troubling and familiar economic scheme double down on the same bad idea of the last decade while argue that , somehow , this time , they 'll lead to a different result .  We have already enact key part of the American Jobs Act - payroll tax relief , tax credit for business that hire veteran , and an extension of unemployment insurance that also include reform like work-sharing , a “ Bridge to Work ” to help the long-term unemployed reconnect with the labor force , and support for unemployed worker look to become entrepreneur .

The housing market 's dramatic collapse do more than punish million of innocent Americans ; it also trigger the economy 's downward spiral into recession .  President Obama take swift action to stabilize a housing market in crisis , help five million family restructure their loan to help them stay in their home , make it easy for family to refinance their mortgage and save hundred of dollar a month , and give tax credit to first-time home buyer .  We will block Republican effort to subject Americans ' guaranteed retirement income to the whim of the stock market through privatization .

It distinguish between democratic procedure of government and the political philosophy of liberalism , but also explain how the two be closely link .  These argument include criticism of the democratic peace hypothesis , the proposition that the process of democratization actually increase the risk of war , claim that in many country democratic election be at best irrelevant and at bad harmful , and the argument that the emergence of the `` Asian model `` of political and economic development demonstrate that liberal democracy be neither appropriate nor necessary in many country .  `` 8 Joseph Schumpeter 's influential 1942 definition saw the `` democratic method `` a `` that institutional arrangement for arrive at political decision in which individual acquire the power to decide by mean of a competitive struggle for the people 's vote .  `` Even in the absence of free election , it be possible to have a free press , religious freedom , associational pluralism , the right to organize union , the right to move freely , and so on .  The United States therefore should attempt to build support for liberal principles-many of which be enshrine in international human-rights treaties-as well a encourage state to hold free and fair election .

In the seventeenth and eighteenth century , the predominant thinking be that a successful nation should export more than it import and that the trade surplus should be use to expand the nation ’ s treasure , primarily gold and silver .  This would allow the country to have a big and more powerful army and navy and more colony .  ” [ 1 ] Mercantilists believe that government should promote export and that government should control economic activity and place restriction on import if need to ensure an export surplus .  Obviously , not all nation could have an export surplus , but mercantilists believe this be the goal and that successful nation would gain at the expense of those less successful .  [ 2 ] Smith argue that when one nation be more efficient than another country in produce a product , while the other nation be more efficient at produce another product , then both nation could benefit through trade .  This would enable each nation to specialize in produce the product where it have an absolute advantage , and thereby increase total production over what it would be without trade .  It imply less government involvement in the economy and a reduction of barrier to trade .  [ 3 ] Ricardo observe that trade will occur between nation even where one country have an absolute advantage in produce all the product trade .

***** 30 AMThose who oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , and other free trade agreement ( FTAs ) invoke three argument .

( Getty/AFP/Paul Ratje ) The federal oil and gas leasing program be break and doesn ’ t work for anyone except oil executives—the same one who pocket more than $ 10 billion in COVID-19 relief payouts while work family be hit hard by the pandemic .

***** Today , we 're talk about the skyrocketing price of oil , and we want to explore whether the high price of oil be a bubble or a permanent , painful reality , or some of both ; how it will affect our economy and what we can do to reduce price and break our dependence on foreign oil .  We know that gas price and the high price of oil and oil product be the number one issue in America .  It 's no wonder that Congress have hold about 40 hearing on oil and energy policy this year , 11 this month alone .  Dan Yergin , a Pulitzer Prize-winning author of `` The Prize , `` and one of the world 's foremost expert on oil and energy .  I think that everyone would like to believe that high oil price be a bubble ; that you burst the bubble and the price will come down and stay down .  Many would like to believe that there 's a silver bullet that could pop the bubble , but if there 's an oil bubble or price temporarily decline and we put off do the necessary thing we have to do , like conservation or invest more in alternative fuel incentive , we 'll be even far behind than we be now , from break our foreign oil dependence .  Demand be on the rise , especially in rapidly-developing large country like China and India , and , in this global economy , they can compete for oil that 's produce here or overseas as well a anybody else , and the high price win .  In fact , the Energy Information Administration be project that oil price will have increase by almost 70 percent from 2007 to 2008 , gasoline will have increase by 35 percent , and diesel price will have increase by 50 percent .  I also think it 's interesting that the big oil company and OPEC be blame speculator for out-of-control price , when they may be much more of the cause .  So a lot of Americans be wonder what Washington can do to bring down oil price and reduce our dependence on oil .  With seven year under the belt of this Administration , the White House have take zero proactive step to reduce our dependence on foreign oil -- zero .  If you do n't do conservation , if you do n't do alternative energy , and you do n't tell the big oil company they can no longer run energy policy in America , we wo n't succeed , plain and simple .  6251 , that will require oil company to use those lease or lose them .
***** 2015 Introduction The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) , be one of the last and large untouched region on earth , home to many wildlife specie and the large potential of untapped reserve of oil in the United States .  However , uncertainty exists in the amount of oil that can be find within the region since only estimate exist which allude to the ANWR a the great source of oil on American soil .  Thus , arctic oil exploration have be debate for decade .  Uncertainty As a wicked problem , oil exploration in ANWR hold great uncertainty .  It be difficult to estimate how much oil there be in this region , how human will impact this delicate ecosystem , and how much the region will be affect by climate change .  With current technology , there be no proven sufficient method of clean up oil spill in the Arctic ( Greenpeace , 2012 ) .  Climate change , currently warm the sea ice , create unpredictable condition for drilling ( Swan and Shearer , 2011 ) .  Oil and Gas Companies Oil and gas company , include Shell , that extract , refine , transport and sell oil , would obviously benefit if they be permit to extract oil from more reserve .  A catastrophic oil spill combine with BP ’ s poor response , can urge Americans to question the adequacy of oil company .
***** Such assessment shall include an assessment of -- ( 1 ) the short-term and long-term outlook for price , supply , and demand for key form of energy , include crude oil and natural gas , and alternative fuel ; ( 2 ) the plan and intention of key energy-producing and export nation with respect to energy production and supply ; ( 3 ) the national security implication of rapidly escalate energy cost ; ( 4 ) the national security implication of potential use of energy resource a leverage against the United States by Venezuela , Iran , or other potential adversary of the United States a a result of increased energy price ; ( 5 ) the national security implication of increase in fund to current or potential adversary of the United States a a result of increased energy price ; ( 6 ) an assessment of the likelihood that increase energy price will directly or indirectly increase financial support for terrorist organization ; ( 7 ) the national security implication of extreme fluctuation in energy price ; and ( 8 ) the national security implication of continued dependence on international energy supply .  About 65 percent of our oil be import from other country , and the price of oil fluctuates with global event .  Although much of the oil we import come from Canada and Mexico , our western hemisphere ally , our oil consumption impact the global oil market .  The list of the top ten holder of oil reserve include Iran , Iraq , Venezuela , Russia and Nigeria .  For the past few year , 20 to 30 percent of Nigeria 's oil output have be disrupt by rebel attack ; Iraq 's production hovers below pre-invasion level and be by no mean stable ; and Iran 's nuclear activity have raise concern around the world .  In addition , over the past few year global oil reserve have decline while global demand for oil have increase .  For instance , 40 percent of the world 's oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf .  Now , this bill be pretty serious , I think , and I believe the reason we need this American-made energy plan , and that this help u understand what the impact of those oil dollar flow overseas every single day , and every day that we do n't do something , mean that we be a little bit in danger , be serious .  The oil company should explore the more than 68 million acre of Federal land that we have already lease to them .

Pelosi send a letter ask the president `` to draw down a small portion `` of the SPR 's more than 700 million barrel of oil `` to help reduce record price that be help push the economy toward recession .  `` Releasing oil from the Reserve be a tool to manage our national and economic security , and when judiciously use will in no way jeopardize national security , `` the California Democrat write .  `` ( Republicans ) be ignore the fact that 68 million acre on shore and offshore could be drill at this moment , `` he say .  `` Providing oil company with additional public land would not lower the price of gas and would not provide relief to American family .  Why we do n't have answer Hunting for oil villians Crude oil .
***** `` The oil company have already be give 68 million acre of federal land , both onshore and offshore , to drill .  They 're allow to drill it , and yet they have n't touch it 68 million acre that have the potential to nearly double America 's total oil production .  Wow , how come the oil company do n't think of that ? .
***** Congressman John Yarmuth For oil company not produce on 68 million acre of U .  land they hold , bill require them to ‘ use it or lose it ' ( Washington , DC ) Congressman John Yarmuth ( KY-3 ) stand with Congressional leader outside the Capitol today to announce new legislation that could dramatically increase the amount of oil produce in the United States .  This measure will compel oil company to utilize the 68 million acre that the federal government lease to them for oil and natural gas production , but that they be fail to use .  oil production from public land and cut oil import by one-third if they start drill and stop stockpile lease .  “ Big oil and it ally have be yell about drilling in pristine wilderness , and all the while , they ’ ve be sit on million of acre of untapped land that they already have permit to drill , ” Congressman Yarmuth say today .  “ The American people work too hard to tolerate the game big oil play to keep gas price high .  We will force the oil company to produce on the federal land they already have or forfeit it to another company that will .  ” Currently , oil company be not produce oil or gas on the nearly 68 million acre of federal land already under their control .
***** Obama be off the mark when he say that oil company have 68 million acre that theyre not use .  As weve point out previously , those 68 million acre of land be not produce oil , but they be not necessarily untouched .  These acre of land that these hole sit on be not count a be produce , but they be certainly far from untouched .
***** HOUSTONThe national debate over open more offshore area to oil and gas exploration have beg the question .  Just what be the company do with the ten of million of acre theyre already lease from the federal government ? .  In particular , congressional Democrats who oppose President Bushs plan to expand offshore drill point to 68 million acre of federal land and offshore site now lease by oil company that sit idle .  Its part of nearly 2 billion acre overseen by two federal agenciesthe Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals Management Servicethat have potential for oil and gas exploration , the bulk of which be strictly off limit .  The 68 million acre under lease to oil company have potential reserve to nearly double U .  An oil company can spend several year after it negotiate a lease secure the permit and other approval it need to begin actual production .  But almost everyone agree it would be year before that oil could be retrieve .

***** Oz Went to the Senate Barack Obama say during last night 's debate that oil and gas company be sit on 68 million acre of lease land that be currently not produce .  If company do n't start drilling , he say , they should lose their lease -- `` use it or lose it .  And if an area of land be n't produce , the reason may not be industry foot-dragging , but the simple fact that there may be no oil or gas under that particular ground .  All non-producing oil and gas lease be in some stage of exploration and development .  If a lease be not produce or do not contain commercial quantity of oil or gas at the end of the initial term of a lease , the lease expire .  Additionally , there be no guarantee that a Federal oil and gas lease contain either oil or gas .  The company award the lease have to evaluate the area first .  It must conduct seismic and other survey to assess the potential for oil and gas be present in the lease and then drill to determine if there be actually any oil or gas within the lease area .  Often at the end of the day there be no oil or gas find .
***** Both party instead have fight bitterly for week over who can make the best political point for the November election , with Republicans press for more domestic oil drilling and Democrats rail about oil company profit .  Congress ' sole legislative response to people 's anger over $ 4 gas and expectation of record heating cost this winter have be to stop a small amount of oil from be ship into the government 's emergency reserve .  The shipment end , but oil and gasoline price continue to rise .  Among them be measure to make energy price gouge a federal crime , to curb oil market speculation , to extend tax credit for wind and solar energy project , to tax the windfall profit of the large oil company , to subject the OPEC oil cartel to U .
***** Energy term As of 2013 , the federal government own between 635 million to 640 million acre , or 28 percent , of the 2 .  27 billion acre of land in the United States .  Approximately 26 percent of the land own by the federal government ( around 166 million acre ) can be lease to private individual and company for energy development , include drill for crude oil and natural gas , solar energy generation , and geothermal energy production .  34 The federal government hold the mineral right for almost all federal land , with the exception of 4 million acre of acquire land .  As of 2015 , the federal government manage roughly 700 million acre of mineral right , half of which contain oil or natural gas reserve .  Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) , 57 million acre have split-estate ownership ( in which private individual have surface right while the federal government own the subsurface mineral right ) , and 385 million acre be manage by other federal agency .  245 The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 permit the BLM to manage oil and gas lease for private individual across 564 million acre of land , include state and federal land , national forest , BLM-managed land , and other area where the federal government posse the mineral right .  According to the BLM , there be 63,000 onshore crude oil and natural gas well on federal land .  These plan contain information on the land 's resource and the potential environmental impact of oil or gas exploration .  The plan identify potential area where oil or gas activity could occur ; these area be know a parcel .  If a bidder secure a lease , the leaseholder have the right to drill for oil or natural gas ( within the parameter give below ) for 10 year or a long a there be a produce well on the parcel .  The graph also show the number of lease where oil or gas be produce ( produce lease ) during this time period .  Royalty fee be charge after oil or natural gas be produce in pay quantity .
***** Senators Russ Feingold ( D-WI ) , Christopher Dodd ( D-CT ) , and Robert Menendez ( D-NJ ) be continue their push to ensure that , before the oil company seek additional lease , they develop the 68 million acre of federal land they currently lease .  The first require oil company to show they be either produce oil or gas - or make progress explore or develop - on current lease before they obtain more .  The Responsible Ownership of Public Land Act , which the trio introduce along with Senator Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) , would charge oil company a fee for every acre of land they lease but do not use for production .  The Senate could vote on the oil speculation legislation a early a Tuesday , July 22 .  `` With oil company ask for more federal land when they be n't produce oil on most of their current lease , it be time for Congress to step in and insist on some accountability , `` Feingold say .  `` Republicans be offer their same fail energy policy - drill , drill , drill - yet 68 million acre be already lease by oil company and leave unexplored .  Instead of continue the policy of pad the coffer of oil executive while American family struggle , it be time to tell these company they can either 'use it or lose it .  While some be call for open up more federal land for drilling , the oil company have not explain why they have not produce on over three-quarters of federal land and water they currently lease .  Federal land and water that be already available for lease contain over 100 billion barrel of oil and gas resource .
***** But oil company do not need more place to drill -- they be sit on 68 million acre of federal land -- or 81 percent of U .  oil reserve -- that they have already lease but have not develop for drilling .  Just how big be Big Oil 's 68 million acre of oil reserve they COULD drill now ? .  Ã‚Â· The fact be 80 percent of the oil available on the Outer Continental Shelf be already open for lease -- but the oil company have decide it 's not worth their money to drill there .

***** A stockpile of federal oil and gas lease across an Ohio-sized swath of land in the West show the fossil fuel industry be prepare for a leasing moratorium for year , former Interior Department official say .  President Joe Biden impose what he describe a a “ pause ” on federal oil and gas leasing on Wednesday a part of his climate policy—while allow million of acre of exist lease to remain unaffected .  But the industry ’ s “ huge inventory ” of undeveloped exist lease and drilling permit be evidence that the oil and gas industry anticipate a “ pause ” in lease long ago , say John Leshy , a law professor at the University of California , Hastings and former Interior solicitor in the Clinton administration .  ” Oil and gas production be occur on less than half of the more than 26 million acre of land already under a federal lease by the end of fiscal 2019 , accord to the most recent federal Bureau of Land Management data , which doesn ’ t include million of acre lease in the Trump administration ’ s final year .  “ We don ’ t get to pick and choose where the oil be locate , ” she say , add that there ’ s a “ tremendous amount of acre that be not develop and may never be develop ” because company haven ’ t find oil or gas .
***** “ Right now , the president have 700 million barrel of oil .  oil production with a new energy package they hope to pass in the come week .  oil company that hold right to some 68 million acre in the low 48 state to use them or lose them .
***** Isaac Eger In such hyper-partisan time , it ’ s nice to know there be some thing both political party can agree on—namely , that we ’ re insanely give the oil industry permission to drill more well while the world burn .  This month , the Biden Administration open up 80 million acre of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas company , make it the largest-ever , off-shore lease sale in U .  On the campaign trail , Biden promise to “ transition away from the oil industry , ” to eliminate emission from the power sector by 2035 and reach net-zero emission across the U .
***** Yet the Obama administration ideological refusal to expand American energy production continue to block the development of resource which could lower price dramatically Most Americans have no idea that the United States be sit on enough technically recoverable oil to power u at current rate of consumption for over 250 year .  7 trillion , add in the resource of Canada and Mexico Without open up more area to drilling , we have no way of know how many more Bakken-sized discovery be wait for u Increasing oil supply will lower fuel price significantly .  The liberal theocracy in academia , the medium and the Democratic Party leadership relentlessly expound that drill for oil in the United States wont much affect U .  gas price , because petroleum price be set in global market Although tension with Iran be grow and push up oil price everywhere , price have diverge between , for example , U .  market be become somewhat separate and less wholly determine by global condition ; hence , more domestic production and increase access to Canadian oil would lower U .  oil and prices—more drilling in the Gulf and elsewhere in North America , and the Keystone pipeline would significantly affect gas price and employment Recently , the President ridicule GOP presidential candidate for urge more domestic petroleum development state , Anyone who tell you we can drill our way out of this problem doesnt know theyre talk about—or just isnt tell you the truth .  Thats simply not so—drilling for more oil in the United States could make a big difference .  But thats not possible because federal policy , support by President Obama and many Democrats , put 83 percent of Americas federal land off limit to drill [ W ] e have 163 billion barrel of recoverable oil nearly six time high than what President Obama and the Democrats like to claim .  Large domestic supply of oil and natural gas be critical to our energy future .

***** Oil and Gas Companies Gain by Stockpiling America ’ s Federal Land The oil and gas industry be use America ’ s public land to pad their own bottom line at the expense of U .  Tackling Climate Change and Environmental Injustice , Energy , Energy and Environment , Environment , Public Lands As of 2017 , nearly 26 million acre of federal land1 be under lease to oil and gas developer in the United States .  In fact , in 2017 , less than half of the nearly 26 million acre be produce any oil and gas .  But some public land advocate and lawmaker have suggest there might exist a more perverse incentive for company to sit on undeveloped federal land .  5 Once a company acquire a lease , it then carry those subsurface reserve a asset on it balance sheet .  By do this , a company can immediately improve it overall financial health , boost it attractiveness to shareholder and investor , and even increase it ability to borrow on favorable term .  While industry leader have suggest it be “ absurd ” to think company would continue to shell out million of dollar in rental fee and lease acquisition solely to pad their balance sheets,6 the relatively low cost of federal land nonetheless provide a strong incentive for company to do just that .  Because of this , company have the potential to directly benefit from amass these undeveloped reserve through federal land lease , while the U .  taxpayer lose out on revenue that could—and should—be generate from well actually produce oil and gas product .  This report explore these possible financial motivation for oil and gas company to acquire and hold undeveloped federal lease a a mean to bolster their bottom line and improve their financial health .
***** Mr Obama be probably base his claim on a June report from the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee , which cite statistic from the Interior Department 's Minerals Revenue Management that classify 67,055,715 acre of oil and gas lease a `` non-producing `` in 2007 .  But just because land be define a `` non-producing `` , it do n't mean that it be not be use .  It can take more than 10 year for an oil company to start produce oil or natural gas from a parcel of land , during which they be often engage in serious exploratory work .  It be mislead for Mr Obama to use statistic about `` non-producing `` land to make a point about oil company not use their exist land hold .  John McCain say that `` an energy bill on the floor of the Senate load down with goody , billion for the oil company .  Mr Obama do vote for the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which do indeed contain tax break for oil company .
***** We , the taxpayer , be subsidize the oil and gas industry with not only these lease , but also with tax break , and they be do nothing but reward u with artificially high price .  “ Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act of 2008 ” Representatives Rahall , Markey , Hinchey , Emanuel and Yarmuth The Problem Currently , oil and gas company hold lease on nearly 68 million acre of federal land ( both onshore and under OCS water ) that they be not develop .  Generally speak , oil and gas lease be issue for a 10-year term that can be renew .  Coal lease be issue for 20 year and coal company have to show that they be “ diligently develop ” their lease during the initial term of the lease .  While coal company be require to diligently develop their lease , oil and gas company be not require to do so .  Because there be no diligent development requirement , oil and gas company can stockpile lease in a non-producing status .  This have encourage oil and gas company to hold nearly 68 million area of federal land ( both onshore and under OCS water ) without produce oil or gas .  The 68 million acre of lease but currently inactive federal land ( both onshore and under OCS water ) could produce an additional 4 .  8 million barrel of oil and 44 .  oil production , and increase natural gas production by 75 % .  oil import by more than a third , and be more than six time the estimate peak production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) .  By foster prompt development of oil and gas lease , we will increase domestic production in area already show to appropriate for energy development .  Companies could avoid this new lease prohibition by relinquish their non-producing lease , create an opportunity for another company to explore for and perhaps produce oil or gas from them .  When oil company bid on a lease , no one know how much oil be under it .  When an oil company buy a lease , it be in effect take a gamble that there will be oil there .  In fact , if an oil lease be not produce , it 's a good bet that drill it do n't make economic sense right now .  The oil company still will hold on to the lease , however , in case drilling will make economic sense in the future a either oil price may go up or drill technology may improve .  3 ) There 's oil there , and the oil company know it , and the oil company be in the process of get it out .  Roughly 3 time a many federal acre - about 68 million - be lease to oil company , but be not currently produce oil or gas .  but not every lease contain oil or natural gas in commercial quantity .  Companies can evaluate lease for several year only to determine that they do not contain oil or natural gas in commercial quantity .  The road to bring the oil and natural gas to market — obtain the lease , evaluation , exploration and production — be a long and complicate one .  If the lease doesn ’ t contain oil or natural gas , then the company shouldn ’ t have buy it .  Only after the lease be acquire , will the company be in the position to evaluate it , usually with a very costly seismic survey follow by an exploration well .  There ’ s absolutely no reason for a company not to produce if it find oil or gas on the lease .  So , there be 68 million acre of lease land on which company be n't extract oil , but Obama go too far when he say oil company `` have n't touch `` them .

Also , implementation of a regional transit authority be still extremely important , so that the exist bus system do not see severe cut .  As plan , the streetcar would be a key piece of the backbone for a truly regional transit system serve a a vital link between the Milwaukee Intermodal Station ( stop on route of Madison-Milwaukee-Chicago high-speed rail and KRM commuter rail system ) , exist MCTS bus route , and Milwaukees dense neighborhood include the East Side , East Town , the Historic Third Ward , and Westown .

Of course that be true , and the reason urban planner want a good start to a comprehensive transit option in Milwaukee be to get the car OFF of the street and highway .  The streetcar in downtown will not immediately relieve the Zoo Interchange congestion , but the transit option that will follow the streetcar into other route in Milwaukee will certainly relieve congestion at a far less expense than that of the Zoo Interchange .  Did you know that your brand new Marquette Interchange cost nearly 10-times the cost of a comprehensive transit option ( like streetcar ) in Milwaukee ? .

It be a singular achievement -- one that have help senior live long , healthy and more productive life ; it 's enhance their financial security ; and it 's give u all the peace of mind to know that there will be health care available for u when we 're in our golden year .  Today , we 've get so many dedicate doctor and nurse and other provider across America provide excellent care , and we want to make sure our senior , and all our people , can access that care .

At a time when every job creator should be encourage to grow and hire , the Democrats health care law instead force employer to choose between rise health care cost and government penalty .

***** Bureau of the Fiscal Service Financial Report of the United States Government Management 's Discussion & Analysis Management 's Discussion & Analysis An Unsustainable Fiscal Path An important purpose of the Financial Report be to help citizen understand current fiscal policy and the importance and magnitude of policy reform necessary to make it sustainable .

Delaying action to reduce the fiscal gap increase the magnitude of spending and/or revenue change necessary to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio .  For example , the magnitude of spending cut and/or revenue increase necessary to close the gap rise about 20 percent if reform be delay ten year , and about 46 percent if reform be delay 20 year .  Delaying fiscal adjustment for too long raise the risk that grow federal debt would increase interest rate , which would , in turn , reduce investment and ultimately economic growth .  the difference between non-interest spending and receipt .

Toomey and Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them.
***** A Trump-Pence administration absolutely would `` punish `` woman who have abortion During Tuesday night ’ s vice presidential debate , Republican Mike Pence challenge Democrat Tim Kaine on how Kaine , a a Catholic , can be pro-choice and support Hillary Clinton ’ s agenda .  Kaine respond that we should “ trust woman ” to make their own moral choice , and add that the Trump-Pence ticket “ want to punish woman ” who have abortion .  “ Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that would punish woman who make the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy , ” Pence say .  First of all , a Pence acknowledge , Trump do in fact say in a March interview with Chris Matthews that if abortion be outlaw , there would have to be “ some form of punishment ” for the woman who have them .  Trump frantically walk it back , and end up take five different position on abortion in three day , but punishment be his initial stance .  But more important than what Trump do or didn ’ t say in that interview be what he and Pence say they will do about abortion .  The extreme anti-abortion bill that Pence have push , both in Congress and a governor of Indiana , would have arguably “ punish ” woman who seek abortion in a wide variety of way — from force woman to cremate or bury the remains of an early miscarriage , to let woman die if they have a life-threatening pregnancy complication in a Catholic hospital that refuse to perform a medically necessary abortion .  And if that happen — whether abortion be outlaw or more heavily criminalize in America — there ’ s no denying that woman would indeed face criminal punishment , regardless of what lawmaker intend .  That ’ s because even today , when abortion be suppose to be legal in America , woman can be arrest or jail on suspicion of self-inducing an abortion — most famously last year in Mike Pence ’ s own state of Indiana .  The mainstream pro-life movement say woman wouldn ’ t be criminally punish if abortion be outlaw The idea of prosecute woman for have abortion be definitely not something the pro-life movement be willing to publicly advocate .  Trump 's comment today be completely out of touch with the pro-life movement and even more with woman who have choose such a sad thing a abortion , `` say Jeanne Mancini , president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund , in a statement at the time .  `` No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who have choose abortion .  Congress have try and fail to pass a national 20-week abortion ban in the past , but it could very easily become law if Trump be president and if Republicans have big enough majority .

The remark prompt an outcry from all quarter , and once again underscored his poor approval rating among woman .  Anti-abortion campaigner , who focus their effort on punish those who carry out abortion , distance themselves from the remark .  The late Trump conflagration begin during the taping of a town hall event , when Matthews ask him to define his “ pro-life ” stance and assertion that abortion should be ban .  Trump ’ s hazy stance on abortion ‘ punishment ’ The 90-second exchange inflame Democratic pro-choice advocate , Republicans who have criticize Trump for flip-flopping on the issue , and anti-abortion advocate .  In a 1999 interview , Trump describe himself a “ pro-choice in every respect ” , and also say he would not “ ban abortion ” if he be ever elect president .  “ If Congress be to pass legislation make abortion illegal and the federal court uphold this legislation , or any state be permit to ban abortion under state and federal law , the doctor or any other person perform this illegal act upon a woman would be hold legally responsible , not the woman .
