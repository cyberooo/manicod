The average American family spend around 11 percent of household income on health care premium and out-of-pocket cost , but that amount approach 20 percent for African American household .  Because African Americans tend to be poor than other demographic group on average , public health insurance program such a Medicaid be vital to ensure affordable health care and healthy outcomes—yet fourteen state have resist Medicaid expansion , mostly in the South .  Even with improved access to medical care under the ACA , the disparity in health outcome between African Americans and white be stark .  African-American woman be three time more likely to die of pregnancy-related cause than white woman , for example , and the African-American infant mortality rate be twice the rate for white infant .  Certain social determinant of health , such a poverty , income inequality , wealth inequality , food insecurity , and the lack of safe , affordable housing have important implication for health risk and the ability to attain health insurance coverage for African Americans .  Another important social factor lead to poor health outcome and economic disadvantage among African Americans be racism , because not only be it a stressor , lead to wear and tear on the body , but it also impact who get what in America , particularly health care .

And with surprising frequency , he would declare himself persuade by something he hear around the table , and modify his vote accordingly .  Because Nino want , above all else , to get each case right — and to do so by work through it with as much discipline and care and disinterestedness a judge could muster .  That doesn ’ t mean he actually get every case right ; SCOTUS vote statistic unmistakably reveal the extent of my doubt on that score .

During her career on the bench , she have repeatedly vote to uphold or suggest she might be likely to uphold restrictive state abortion law .  ” [ 22 ] She also would have vote to uphold the state ’ s requirement that fetal remains be cremate or bury because it be a rational requirement in furtherance of the state ’ s “ legitimate interest in protect public sensibility ” that do not burden the right to abortion .  Or , a her academic writing suggests , she could vote to squarely overrule Roe , a precedent that she clearly do not deem deserving of respect .

They would not meet with Judge Garland , hold a hearing on his nomination , or allow a vote for 293 day .  Still , we have a heavy heart a we have see the passing of civil right great like C .  Americans know that the decision of this body a it relate to the Supreme Court be go to affect some of the deep issue that affect their life -- their economic security , their bodily autonomy , their right to vote , their civil right , the environment in which we all live -- and the area I most want to focus on be their healthcare -- their healthcare .  Millions of Americans have lose their job , and 30 million Americans werent get enough food to eat .  I know the difference that the Affordable Care Act make , and in particular the difference that Medicaid expansion have make , especially for community like mine in the State of New Jersey , like the one in which I live , of hardworking people who be still at the low echelon of our economic nation .  The Affordable Care Act fall would mean at a time when Black and Latino Americans be disproportionately die of this virus , reverse the gain of the Affordable Care Act have make in narrow those disparity now , we would see those community with less coverage , less care , less access , less justice .

I also think it encompass basically all young people who have any money at all invest in any which way ; anyone who invest in a tracker fund , which be just a fund that track all of the stock in a particular index , so you basically own a little slice , a representative slice , of the whole market — anybody who own one of those for at least a medium amount of time .  And young people in general , plus all these huge fund like pension fund , would count a universal owner .  And I think that what we need to do be to have those group realize that any externality that one company produce , the cost of those get pick up elsewhere in the portfolio .

Ice fishing in Wisconsin date back well before the arrival of European settler to when American Indians chop hole in the ice in order to spear fish to supplement their winter diet .  But a any ice fisherman know , the season with ice thick enough to walk on be short , and can end suddenly and unpredictably with the onset of warm weather .  With climate change model predict warm temperature , we can expect to see a trend towards few day of ice-covered lake a each year pa .  In fact , with the aid of a remarkable dataset from Madisons lake , scientist infer that a change in ice duration have already take place .

Though , data on Lake Mendota ’ s freeze pattern date back to the 1850s show the lake only freeze 25 time in January over 150 year or approximately 16 % of the time .  Magnuson say in the 1850s , about five month of ice would cover Mendota on average .  Due to later ice-on date in more recent year , Mendota now have about four month of ice cover per year .  Magnuson say while inter-year variability factor such a the exact temperature , wind and cloudiness contribute heavily to a lake ’ s final freeze date , the late ice-on trend can be trace back to a warm climate .  Magnuson say if a lake doesn ’ t have any ice , it lose the winter season because the ice be what protect the lake from mix .

***** 7-1/2 `` thick , stage 5 ( rotten ) , S2 ( small grain ) ice .  You ca n't quite stomp through the ice but probably will be able to in an hour or two .  Based on press report of 2013 season ice mishap , ice during or after a warm spell account for more breakthrough than thin but cold ice .  Relatively short warm spell can create a bunch of new hazard , some of which can last for several day or even week after the thaw end .  Knowing the temperature , wind and sunniness history for the past seven to ten day can give you a good idea of when to expect ice weaken by thaw .  Knowing when to get off or stay off the ice in thaw condition be a key skill for stay dry ( and alive ) .  Well thaw ice that be well over a foot thick may not support a person while cold ice that be two inch thick will do so with a reasonable safety margin ( on a small lake ) .  Thawing be the process of ice decay .  Thaw condition can occur anytime during the ice season .  The minimum thickness recommend for activity on cold ice get a lot of attention but more people break through ice that be weaken by thaw than break through cold ice that be too thin .  Roughly half the fatality in North America probably would not have happen if the weather have stay consistently below freeze for 10 day prior to the accident .  Many people ( myself include ) seem to have a hard time decide when it the ice be get too thaw to be sufficiently trustworthy .  Being especially well prepared for fall through and have enough ice experience to have a sense of when it be likely to get too weak be very important .  If you can , stay off area of small grain ice on your way back to shore .

Local lake be highly sensitive to global temperature , make lake ice one of the resource most threaten by climate change .  For the first time ever , scientist have provide an estimate of how many lake across the Northern Hemisphere will lose ice cover and when .  Researchers find characteristic such a air temperature , lake depth , elevation and shoreline all affect it susceptibility to ice cover .  Already , thanks to climate change , about 15,000 lake that use to reliably freeze each winter be start to miss season .  Even under the best circumstance , in which the global community meet the target set by the Paris climate agreement , the number of lake with intermittent freezing will likely double by the time the climate warms by 2 degree Celsius .  Instead , they will experience `` intermittent `` ice , mean one year the lake might freeze and the next it might not .

These record be not common , but the ice cover data for lake in Madison , WI provide a good example of a valuable dataset for identify these trend .  As University of Wisconsin-Madison lake researcher John Magnuson say , We can recall the past and sense change only when we keep record .  Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have data record the formation and melting of ice on Lakes Mendota and Monona in Madison since 1855 .  Overall , the average number of day of ice cover on the Madison lake have decrease by around 29-35 day over the past 150 year .
***** Tell u about your recent report on how climate change be impact Lake Michigan and inland lake .  We ’ re also see a change in fish population in Lake Michigan and inland lake .  One big change certain fisherman may have notice be that the amount of ice cover have decline .  Lakes in the Midwest now freeze later in the year and the ice break earlier .  Ice fishing have already have a dramatic decrease in the length of the season in Midwest , and that ’ s likely to continue .  They ’ re find in inland glacial lake in the Midwest .
***** We convene this hearing at a critical time in history , when the continue use of fossil fuel be contribute to change in the world 's climate that appear , in turn , to be cause rapid melting of polar ice -- an occurrence that will likely have significant consequence for the United States and , indeed , for the world .  In the Arctic , the melting of polar ice pack be accelerate to the point that the National Snow and Ice Data Center have report that , by September of this year , the North Pole may briefly be ice-free .  The melting of polar ice be a catalyst for what appear to be increase interest in the creation of new shipping passage , particularly in the Arctic , as well a the new scramble for the assertion of national control over natural resource .  The other critical icebreaking mission perform by the Coast Guard involve break ice on the Great Lakes and along the East Coast of the United States .  As a result , during last winter , several vessel on the Great Lakes suffer ice-related damage .  I be concern , however , that the current icebreaking fleet be unable to carry out the full mission load in heavy ice year like we have experience in the last several year in the Great Lakes .  It be expect that vessel traffic in the Arctic will increase dramatically a Arctic Sea ice condition continue to change .  This arrangement have facilitate the movement of more than $ 334 million of cargo on the Great Lakes during the 2006-2007 ice season .  But this past winter , when there be a need for icebreaking capability on Lake Superior -- at the beginning of the spring shipping season there be still a great deal of ice , slush ice , heavy ice , shore ice -- the Mackinaw be not available to come upstream , up-lake and serve in there .

***** When I speak before on the floor of Congress about the need to address global warming , one of the thing I say , and this be about 6 week ago , be that in Wisconsin , ice fisherman be already notice few day they can be out on our ice-covered lake .  Now , the conservative right in Wisconsin , they decide to have a field day .  He say , can you imagine in Wisconsin , where this winter we have day that be minus 22 degree , real temperature , minus 40 and 50 degree with wind chill , how can we possibly be talk about few day of ice coverage .  Specifically , they be ask to address that statement that I make , which be , ice fisherman be already notice few day they can be out on our ice-covered lake .  They have be track ice coverage on the lake in Madison , Lake Mendota , and Lake Monona , go back 150 year .

Seasonal change in lake and reservoir Temperature be also important in lake and reservoir .  Many lake experience a `` turning `` of it water layer when the season change .  Since warm water be less dense that colder water , it stay on top of the lake surface .  But , in winter some lake surface can get very cold .
***** As the climate warms , ten of thousand of lake may spend winter ice free January 28 , 2019 By Adam Hinterthuer Image show the zone where lake will become intermittent-ice lake , base on the temperature rise .  In many part of the Northern Hemisphere , frozen lake define the winter experience and create an indelible sense of place .  From ice fishing and hockey to skating , skiing and snowmobiling , icy lake enable community to engage in activity that aren ’ t possible in warm season or climate .  Madison , show that many northern latitude lake be at risk of experience some ice-free winter in the come decade .  In some place , lake ice will disappear altogether by the end of the century .  According to it author , the study — lead by Professor Sapna Sharma of York University — offer “ the first global estimate of how many lake be likely to lose winter ice cover a climate warms .  Madison , say the team develop a model that allow them to predict which lake would lose ice first and how that ice loss would be distribute across different latitude .  some year be cold enough that the lake freeze over and other year be warm enough that they don ’ t .  ” As annual average air temperature warm , this intermittent ice zone move north , eventually leave the lake south of it look at an ice-free future .
***** Even though there be some decent day come , the amount of snow that have arrive be the nail in the coffin for our lake be open for the opener .  The bad part of this be that it be so tough to get out on the lake that hardly anyone be ice fish either .  We need some really warm weather — and sun — to knock the snow level down to be able to get around on the lake .  And that doesn ’ t take into account some slush on the lake .

But the substance of the bill they so hate , Kind say , incorporate many of the solution they themselves have long support — competitive marketplace , cost constraint , the individual mandate force patient to buy care .  They fail to wrestle with how to make good on their promise to dismantle a bill whose underlying policy include many of their key idea .

The CBO say that health reform would increase premium in the nongroup market by 10 percent to 13 percent—and that this would be more than offset by new federal subsidy for the majority of purchaser , and would reflect in part an increase in the policy ’ value .  Initially it president , Karen Ignani , emphasize the weak individual mandate .

***** Since youre read Rolling Stone , the chance be youre an American between say 18 and 35 , which demographically make you a Young Voter .  In fact , even if youre read other stuff in RS , it doubtful youre go to read much of this article such be the enormous shuddering yawn that the Political Process evokes in u now , in this post-Watergate-post-IranContra postWhitewater post Lewinsky era , an era when politician statement of principle or vision be understand a self-serving ad copy and judge not for their sincerity or ability to inspire but for their tactical shrewdness , their marketability .  So when Senator John McCain say , in Michigan or South Carolina ( which be where Rolling Stone send the least professional pencil it could find to spend the standard medium Week on the Bus with a candidate whod never ride high than he be right now ) , when McCain say I run for president not to Be Somebody , but to Do Something , it hard to hear it a anything more than a marketing angle , especially when he say it a he go around surround by camera and reporter and cheer crowd in other word , Being Somebody .  And when Senator John McCain also say constantly , thump it at the start and end of every speech and THM that his goal a president will be to inspire young Americans to devote them- self to cause great than their own self-interest , it hard not to hear it a just one more piece of the carefully script bullshit that presidential candidate hand u a they go about the self-interested business of try to become the most powerful , important and talked-about human be on earth , which be of course their real cause , to which they appear to be so deeply devote that they can swallow and spew whole mountain of noble sound bullshit and convince even themselves that they mean it .  Cynical a that may sound , poll show it how most of u feel .  It have to do with McCains military background and Vietnam combat and the five-plus year he spend in a North Vietnamese prison , mostly in solitary , in a box , get torture and starve .  They say he could just leave .  military Code of Conduct for Prisoners of War apparently say that POWs have to be release in the order they be capture , and there be others whod be in Hoa Lo a long time , and McCain refuse to violate the Code .  And so then he spend four more year in Hoa Lo like this , much of the time in solitary , in the dark , in a closet-sized box call a punishment cell .  The fact that John McCain in this morning speech several time invoke a moral poverty in America , a loss of shame that he blame on the ceaseless assault of violence-driven entertainment that have lose it moral compass to greed ( McCains metaphor tend to mix a bit when he get excite ) , and make noise that sound rather a lot like propose possible federal regulation of all US entertainment , which would have dicey constitutional implication to say the leastthis hold no immediate interest for CNN .

We always say traditionally the veteran community and the military community have be Conservative and Republican , but you and I know that that have be a change factor in the last 20 year , especially a the new generation of veteran and service member serve for various reason .  We saw an opportunity to go directly at organize that community , and say , `` Look , there 's other option .  I mean we do swear an oath to the Constitution , and what we 've see in the last , I think , five year especially , have be some very direct attack on what that oath mean , and we 've see some vast politicization of the military in those effort .  A lot of u have really change .  Really the final straw for me be when Trump say John McCain be n't a hero .

***** John McCain ( R-AZ ) say it would be fine with him if the U .  military stay in Iraq for a hundred year or even a million year .  Fifty-nine percent say the U .  should stick to a withdrawal timetable instead of keep a significant number of troop in Iraq until the situation there get good , even if that take many year .
***** These men share an obvious bond , and over the year they have more readily cross partisan line than other senator , constitute , in some way , a party unto themselves .  Last year , after House Democrats vote to set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq , McCain and Webb  both of whom be feature hero in a classic book on the era , Robert Timberg ’ s “ Nightingale ’ s Song ”  become embroil in an unusually public disagreement .  After McCain pointedly say the enemy in Iraq be celebrate along with Democrats , Webb accuse him of unfairly question other people ’ s patriotism .  When Webb and Hagel ( a close personal friend of McCain ’ s ) propose a bill to give troop leave Iraq and Afghanistan more time at home before redeploy , McCain , whose 19-year-old son have serve with the Marines in Iraq , forcefully oppose them , say the troop be need in the theater .  Among his fellow combat veteran in the Senate , past and present , he be the only one who have continue to champion the war in Iraq ; by contrast , Kerry , Webb and Hagel have emerge in the year since the invasion a unsparing critic of American involvement there .  And yet in private discussion with friend and colleague , some of them have point out that McCain , who be shoot down and capture in 1967 , spend the bad and most costly year of the war seal away , both from the rice paddy of Indochina and from the outside world .  During those year , McCain do not share the disillusioning and morally jar experience of soldier like Kerry , Webb and Hagel , who find themselves unable to recognize their enemy in the confusion of the jungle ; he never undergo the conversion that cause Kerry , for one , to toss away some of his war decoration during a protest at the Capitol .  But some suspect that whatever lesson McCain take away from his time in Vietnam , it be not the one that stay with his colleague who be “ in country ” during those year  that some war simply can ’ t be win on the battlefield , no matter how long you fight them , no matter how many soldier you send there to die .  It ’ s fair to say , then , that McCain do evolve in his view on when and how to use American force over the course of the decade , but it ’ s mislead to separate his evolution from the large transformation that be happen all around him .  “ So , ” McCain say finally , “ with that preface , I ’ d be glad to answer any question you might have , and again , it ’ s always good to be with you .  As McCain and I talk , the Democratic National Committee have begin broadcast an ad that repeatedly show him say at a New Hampshire campaign event that he would be fine with keep American troop in Iraq for 100 year .  The quote have be rip out of context  he go on to say that such a troop presence would be possible only without casualty , in the same way that American soldier have remain quietly for decade in South Korea and Europe  but it have already become a staple of Democratic attack , and McCain could expect to see it about half a million more time before November .

***** In finalize the remainder of the 2022 payment rule in April 2021 , HHS make clear that future rulemaking would address , at a minimum , the subset of policy that the Trump administration finalize before inauguration day , such a allow state to transition away from HealthCare .  Some reverse other Trump-era regulation that , for instance , limit the duration of the annual open enrollment period ( OEP ) or require double billing for certain abortion service .  The preamble emphasize that expand access to coverage and affordability be critical to advance health equity .  Half of the nation uninsured population be people of color and even people with health insurance face barrier to care because of affordability , health literacy , and a lack of in-network provider .  This change will make it easy for low-income people to enroll in marketplace coverage throughout the year and could be especially critical to help the million of people who be expect to lose Medicaid coverage at the end of the declared public health emergency successfully transition to exchange coverage .  The low-income SEP will be available only through the exchange ( not for off-exchange coverage in the broad individual market ) and only at the option of the exchange , so state-based exchange ( SBEs ) can choose to implement , or not implement , the SEP .  Exchanges can choose the coverage effective date to be either the first day of the month follow plan selection or to align with exist rule .  Individuals could not , say , switch to a gold plan mid-year and then back to a silver plan .  Many commenters support the new low-income SEP and emphasize it potential to advance health equity and increase coverage among low-income and hard-to-reach community .  As discus here , concern about adverse selection may be overblown because 1 ) comparable state experience have not result in adverse selection ; 2 ) those eligible for the low-income SEP will be primarily motivate to enroll in coverage because of generous subsidy ( rather than a health need ) ; and 3 ) the remain uninsured be disproportionately young , mean this SEP could increase enrollment of young consumer , thereby improve the health of the overall risk pool .

***** Budgets & Projections Last year be a historically bad year for the Congressional budget process .  Since 1976 , it be the first time that neither the Senate or House vote on a budget .  And the House have always do a budget in a non-election year like this one .  Since the modern budget process start in 1976 , there have only be two year when neither chamber approve a budget .  2010 , during consideration of the budget for Fiscal Year ( FY ) 2011 , and last year , during consideration of the budget for FY 2019 .  In that year , neither the House nor Senate approve a budget resolution .  But even in 2010 , several budget resolution be vote down in the Senate , and the Senate Budget Committee have propose a budget .  The deadline for Congress to complete action on a budget be April 15 , and Congress have only hit that mark four time ( plus an additional two time when the deadline be May 15 before 1986 ) .  More often , Congress have treat the budget deadline a a deadline for one chamber or the other to pass a budget .  Out of the 44 year between FY 1976 and 2019 , the House have fail to vote on a budget by the deadline 14 time and the Senate 19 time .  Based on the fiscal year for which the budget be be do , not the year of the vote .  Of the 14 year that the House do not consider a budget by the deadline , 11 be in election year and only 3 in non-election year .  The House have never fail to pass a budget in a non-election year .  This year , the Senate Budget Committee have approve a budget , which have not yet be consider by the full Senate , and the House Budget Committee have not yet propose a budget .
***** It be barely news that the President ’ s signature avoid a costly government shutdown or that the Senate have never even consider any of the 12 annual appropriation bill that be suppose to fund the government .  This failure of government be ignore because the federal budget process have be break for decade .  Over that nearly half-century , Congress pass all it appropriation bill on time on only four occasion .  It be extremely difficult for agency and government contractor to plan and make hiring decision when they don ’ t know their budget until after the fiscal year begin .

Unfortunately , recent Congresses have not adhere to the budget process , and policymakers have instead allow the federal budget process to virtually collapse .  Among the way the budget process have break down .  Congress regularly miss budget deadline .  A concurrent budget resolution be suppose to be approve each year by April 15 ( prior to 1986 the deadline be May 15 ) .  The House have only pass it budget resolution 16 time by then and the Senate have only pass a budget resolution by then 20 time .  Between 1975 and 1997 , a budget resolution be approve every single year .  Since 2010 , only three budget resolution have be approve , and none have be abide by or implement in any meaningful way .  While the budget process have be break down over decade , it have get much bad in recent year .  In 2018 , for the first time under the modern budget process , neither the House nor the Senate vote on or approve a budget resolution .  It have be report that the House Budget Committee will not consider a budget resolution for Fiscal Year ( FY ) 2021 , and the Senate Budget Committee may not either .  Of the 45 year since 1975 , the House have pass a resolution by the deadline 29 time , the Senate 25 time , and both chamber have agree to a concurrent resolution on time only six time .  Yet despite these miss deadline , Congress ultimately put forward a budget resolution every single year between 1975 and 1997 .  In 7 of those year , the Senate do not even pass it own budget resolution ; in three year , neither the House nor Senate pass a budget resolution .  neither chamber even consider a budget resolution on the floor for the first time since the modern budget process be establish .  And this year , it be possible that neither budget committee will approve a budget , which have never happen in the history of the modern budget process .  A Country Needs a Budget Congress be unlikely to make much of an effort to approve a budget resolution for FY 2021 .
***** Reflections on the Congressional Budget Act Learning from Previous Budget Reform Efforts In reform the congressional budget process , Congress should strengthen nonpartisan institution such a the CBO , put tax and spending on a level playing field , and eliminate brinkmanship over the debt ceiling .  The far-reaching tax change be rush through Congress in a matter of week under the special fast-track budget reconciliation process , strain procedure that have be design to ensure deliberative and inclusive consideration of fiscal policy .  The majority in Congress choose to disregard the budget impact estimate of the Joint Committee on Taxation ( JCT ) and the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , while the Treasury Department produce no public revenue or distributional analysis of the bill .  2 It be essential to restore rationality and basic norm to the budget process in order to ensure that this approach do not set a new and dangerous precedent for the nation .  The current budget process be establish by the landmark Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 , also call the Congressional Budget Act ( CBA ) .  Understanding the success and failure of the CBA can inform a way forward toward achieve a more effective budget process .  It improve the availability of information to inform decision-making and establish an annual process for develop and approve the federal budget .  The result of the 1974 CBA have be mix , however , in term of both it state goal and the budget process that evolve .  In hindsight , it succeed most where it improve the information and analytical capacity available to Congress and enhance congressional authority over the budget .  It have be less successful in ensure that Congress enact timely budget .  While the budget process at first work largely a intend , adherence in Congress to the CBA ’ s process and deadline have erode , and today , the budget process have be warp by brinkmanship and partisan posturing , a member of Congress increasingly use budget chokepoint to try to extract policy concession from the other side .  22 Since it enactment , there have be only six occurrence where Congress adopt a budget resolution on time .  23 On average , Congress miss the deadline by 36 day , and since 1999 , there be nine year in which no budget resolution be adopt at all .  Crucially , reconciliation bill can not be filibuster in the Senate , so they can pass with a majority of vote rather than three-fifths .  The expectation of an annual congressional budget put some pressure on party caucus to produce one—but congressional budget increasingly fail to provide an honest accounting of their author ’ priority .  They be require when Congress and the president have fail to enact regular appropriation bill before the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1 .  Streamlining the budget process The timeline for congressional budgeting have almost entirely broken down in recent year .

But it be her effort in the late ’ 80 and early ’ 90 to create the nation ’ s longest-running private school voucher program that mark her career .

***** In recent year , a vigorous debate have emerge on the use of educational voucher to encourage great choice to parent and student in public education service delivery .  Policy maker have offer school choice and voucher proposal in the context of the reauthorization of IDEA .  Yet , no comprehensive examination have be make of the general condition that determine whether school voucher be an effective educational instrument for student with disability .  The National Council on Disability 's ( NCD ) School Vouchers and Students with Disabilities policy paper provide a rationale for as the issue of school voucher , and contain the following major find .  1 ) IDEA right , a a general rule , will not extend to child and youth with disability who participate in voucher program .  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act will still apply to the administration of the voucher program but not to most activity of the private school .  2 ) School choice and voucher option have expand slowly over the past decade and establish beachhead in several urban set with mixed result from large-scale evaluative study .  Special education have be leave out of the process for the most part , with the exception of the statewide Florida McKay Scholarship Program , which may not provide a working model for extend voucher under reauthorized IDEA since it do not hold private school of choice to the same accountability requirement to which public school be hold .  3 ) Because voucher can only cover a portion of cost of special education over and above the cost of private school tuition in many case , particularly for student with moderate , low-incidence and severe disability , such program may benefit only the affluent who can afford to supplement voucher to cover actual cost .  INTRODUCTION This policy paper address the applicability and/or efficacy of extend publicly fund school voucher option to student with disability serve under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) .  This paper will primarily focus on voucher that allow public education fund to be use by eligible participant to attend private school and the impact of such program on the education of student with disability .  Under this program , which begin in 2000 , family of student with disability may receive voucher for the asking , regardless of their school ' grade for performance a determine by the state .  These voucher have a value equal to the exist , annual expenditure for educate the student a estimate by the District , or the cost of private school-of-choice tuition , whichever be the less amount .

Nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote.

***** Although the extent of the right protect by substantive due process may be controversial , it theoretical basis be firmly establish and form the basis for much of modern constitutional case law .  Passage of the Reconstruction Amendments ( 13th , 14th , and 15th ) give the federal court the authority to intervene when a state threaten fundamental right of it citizens,39 and one of the most important doctrine ﬂowing from this be the application of the Bill of Rights to the state through the Due Process Clause .  Though application of these right against the state be no longer controversial , the incorporation of other substantive right , a be discuss in detail below , have be .  43 Although various decision have hold that the “ liberty ” guarantee by the Fourteenth Amendment be the liberty of natural,44 not artificial , persons,45 nevertheless , in 1936 , a newspaper corporation successfully object that a state law deprive it of liberty of the press .  54 Mere “ cost and inconvenience ( different word , probably , for the same thing ) would have to be very great before they could become an element in the consideration of the right of a state to exert it reserved power or it police power .  —As will be discuss in detail below , the substantive “ liberty ” guarantee by the Due Process Clause have be variously define by the Court .  In the early year , it mean almost exclusively “ liberty of contract , ” but with the demise of liberty of contract come a general broadening of “ liberty ” to include personal , political and social right and privilege .  58 Nonetheless , the Court be generally chary of expand the concept absent statutorily recognize right .

***** The right of citizen of the United States to vote shall not be deny or abridge by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude .  Amendment 15 The right of citizen of the United States to vote shall not be deny or abridge by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude .  Nault Professor of Law , Capital University Law School Most Americans probably believe the right to vote be one of their most fundamental constitutional right .  It will come a a surprise , therefore , to learn that neither the original Constitution nor the Bill of Rights nor any other provision of the Constitution expressly guarantee the right to vote .  Once the Court recognize the right to vote , decision of the Supreme Court help revolutionize the way voting be treat under American constitutional law .  Most of the law concern the right to vote develop under the Fourteenth Amendment , though important Court decision also have rely at time on the Fifteenth Amendment .  The reason the original Constitution and the Bill of Rights do not expressly protect the right to vote be that do so would have be too controversial and divisive at the time .  Different state have different rule for who could vote ( many state have property-holding requirement and differ on the amount ; some state permit woman and free black men to vote , others do not ) .  The only place where voting be directly recognize in the original Constitution be for choose member of the House of Representatives ; Article I , Section 2 provide that the people eligible to vote for member of the U .  House will be determine by whom the States let vote for their own house of representative .  these be call first-generation voting right claim , because they involve the basic right of be able to vote at all .  do these law impose a severe burden on the right to voteor a reasonable , non-discriminatory one ; and do the state have a good enough reason for enact these law ? .  In Crawford , the Court conclude that law require proof of identity to vote be not per se unconstitutional , but leave open the possibility that particular voter-identification law might be unconstitutional if they impose a severe burden on the right to vote without sufficient justification .

In fact , many state adopt `` black code `` that forbade African American citizen to vote or hold office , and incident of violence against both black and white unionist proliferate throughout the South .
***** If you ’ re look for the right to vote , you win ’ t find it in the United States Constitution or the Bill of Rights .  The Bill of Rights recognize the core right of citizen in a democracy , include freedom of religion , speech , press and assembly .  But the framer of the Constitution never mention a right to vote .  To put it most simply , the founder didn ’ t trust ordinary citizen to endorse the right of others .  They be create a radical experiment in self-government pair with the protection of individual right that be often resent by the majority .  As a result , they do not lay out an inherent right to vote because they fear rule by the mass would mean the destruction of .  all the other right the Constitution and Bill of Rights uphold .  Americans may have come to believe in a universal vote , but that value do not come from the Constitution , which saw a different path to the protection of right .
***** Perhaps the most important of those thing the most fundamental of those thing be the right to vote .  The right to vote freely .

Enshrining an affirmative Right to Vote in the Constitution would be one more step toward universal suffrage and equal voting right for all .  While this amendment would not specifically give citizen of the territory the right to vote automatically , it do open the doorway for them to gain the ability to vote for president .  citizen have a constitutional right to vote , it do lay the groundwork for an argument against the Electoral College .

Well , many of our most cherish right be guarantee in the kind of language the homeowner use .

This report be the late in that series—and it show a cumulative 10-year deficit that be slightly large and a cumulative 30-year deficit that be notably large than those in CBO ’ s previous projection .  0 percent for more than five consecutive year .  And during the past 50 year , deficit have average 1 .

***** Aug 17 , 2021 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print The number of people enrol in Medicare have increase steadily in recent year , and along with it , Medicare spending .  As enrollment in Medicare Advantage continue to grow , these trend have important implication for total Medicare spending , and cost incur by beneficiary .  This analysis examine Medicare spend per person for beneficiary in Medicare Advantage , relative to traditional Medicare .  We build on prior work publish by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ( MedPAC ) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) Office of the Actuary ( OACT ) to provide estimate of the amount Medicare would have spend for Medicare Advantage enrollee have they be cover under traditional Medicare in 2019 ( the most recent year for which data be available ) .  We then illustrate potential saving to the Medicare program between 2021 and 2029 under two alternative scenario where Medicare Advantage spending per person be low or grow slow than under current projection .  The Medicare Advantage spending amount include the cost of extra benefit , fund by rebate , not available to traditional Medicare beneficiary .  If spending per Medicare Advantage enrollee be 2 percent less each year than project by the Medicare actuary , similar to the project impact of a recommendation make by MedPAC , total Medicare spending would be $ 82 billion low between 2021 and 2029 .  The decrease be approximately 1 percent of total Medicare benefit spending over these year ( and 2 percent of Medicare Advantage spending ) .  Comparing the two alternative scenario , the reduction in Medicare Advantage spending be similar in the initial year of the time period .  For example , MedPAC examine the response of Medicare Advantage plan that lose bonus status between 2018 and 2019 and find that these plan reduce their profit and administrative cost , and have low growth in their project Part A and B cost compare to other plan .
***** 9 percent cost-of-living adjustment ( COLA ) in their 2022 Social Security benefits—the large COLA in 30 year .  It also reflect the need to maintain a contingency reserve for unanticipated increase in health care spending , particularly certain drug cost .  For example , a retired worker who currently receive $ 1,565 per month from Social Security can expect to receive a net increase of $ 70 .  40 more per month after the Medicare Part B premium be deduct .
***** Getty Images Medicare Part B premium While the cost-of-living adjustment usually go up every year , so do Medicare Part B premium that old Americans pay for physician and outpatient service .  30 per month for high income people .
***** The Medicare Advantage average monthly premium will be the low in the last thirteen year for the more than 24 million people with Medicare who be project to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan for 2020 .  low cost , more option , and benefit tailor to patient ’ need .  ” This news come a the agency release the benefit and cost-sharing information for Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plan for the 2020 calendar year .  65 billion in Medicare Advantage and Part D premium cost since 2017 .  The continued decline in Medicare Advantage and Part D premium over the past three year be estimate to save taxpayer nearly $ 6 billion in the form of low Medicare premium subsidy .
***** In the come month , Congress may consider policy change aim at expand coverage and reduce overall health care spending , perhaps a part of a broad reconciliation bill .  Paying low price would , in turn , allow a public option to set low premium or impose less enrollee cost-sharing , which would directly reduce consumer ’ cost and reduce the federal government ’ s cost of subsidize premium and cost-sharing ( in some combination ) .  In brief , I argue that a public option would likely need two key feature .  I conclude that , without pay provider less , a public option likely could not set low premium than typical exist plan ; it low administrative cost and lack of a profit margin would likely be more than offset by disadvantage in utilization management , risk selection , and diagnosis coding .  Thus , for this type of public option to create significant value , it would need to offer good coverage than exist plan ( and convince consumer of that fact ) .  Commercial plan appear to pay even more in relation to Medicare for outpatient facility service .  Despite the fact that Medicare pay much low price than commercial plan , Medicare beneficiary have robust access to provider .  This likely reflect the fact that Medicare ’ s price , while far below commercial price , still exceed provider ’ marginal cost of deliver care , which ensure that serve Medicare beneficiary be profitable for health care provider .
***** 105 percent of traditional Medicare rate and , in real economic term , possibly less .  1 Integral to such a policy discussion be the assessment of the cost containment performance of Medicare Advantage ( MA ) plan compare to traditional Medicare .  These bid be base on the plan ’ estimate of the cost of provide require Medicare Part A , which cover most medically necessary hospital ; skilled nursing facility ; home health and hospice care ; and Part B service , which cover medically necessary service by provider and other service deem medically necessary , to cover an average beneficiary .  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ( MedPAC ) use MA plan bid projection a a proxy for cost to annually compare the Medicare program ’ s project MA spending with project traditional Medicare spending .  3 It be know that MA plan cost for administration and profit be approximately 11 .  13 percent of plan ’ total cost of provide benefit to Medicare beneficiary compare to traditional Medicare administrative cost of 1 .

It may not be popular nor politically expedient , but we be always at our best when we put aside the small politics of the day in the interest of our nation and the value upon which they rest .  President , allow me to turn to the substance of this resolution .  Until the government and it coalition ally can protect the population , the Iraqi people will increasingly turn to extra- governmental force , especially Sunni and Shiite militia , for protection .

Among his fellow combat veteran in the Senate , past and present , he be the only one who have continue to champion the war in Iraq ; by contrast , Kerry , Webb and Hagel have emerge in the year since the invasion a unsparing critic of American involvement there .  ( In a new book , Hagel , who voice deep concern about Iraq even a he vote for the war resolution in 2002 , predict that the war will turn out to be “ the most dangerous and costly foreign-policy debacle in our nation ’ s history .

***** I also argue that the Internet be the best source of information concern complex event like Terror War , while mainstream US corporate medium , especially broadcast , have become instrument of propaganda for the Bush administration and Pentagon during spectacle of terrorism and war .

In 1972 , Palestinian gunman from the same movement stun the world when they take Israeli athlete hostage at the Munich Olympic Games , produce another medium spectacle turn into an academy award-winning documentary film .  In 1975 , an OPEC ( Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries ) meeting be disrupt in Vienna , Austria when a terrorist group lead by the notorious Carlos the Jackal enter , kill three people and wound several in a chaotic shootout .  Americans be target in a 1983 terror campaign in Beruit Lebanon orchestrate by a Shiite Muslim suicide bomber , in which 243 US serviceman be kill ; this lead the US to withdraw it troop from Lebanon .  The September 11 terror spectacle look like a disaster film , lead Hollywood director Robert Altman to chide his industry for produce extravaganza of terror that could serve a model for spectacular terror campaign .

Features & AnalysisPowerMining By James Murray 05 Oct 2020 Over the past decade , more than 50 coal company have go bankrupt and over 100GW of coal capacity have either retire or announce plan to retire Trump say his administration would `` take care of a lot of year of horrible abuse `` towards the coal industry ( Credit .  Shutterstock/1427778647 ) When Donald Trump be elect to the White House in 2016 , he pledge to revive a US coal industry that be in seemingly terminal decline due to his predecessor Barack Obama ’ s stringent regulation on fossil fuel .  But a new data show power generation from the mineral fell to a 43-year low in 2019 and renewables look set to overtake coal production for the first time ever this year , James Murray explore what go wrong .  Behind him be stand more than a dozen coal miner , whose job he swear to protect from the red tape of green bureaucracy a he launch an executive order that could eventually lead to the repealing of his predecessor Barack Obama ’ s signature climate change policy .  His Ohio-headquartered company , Murray Energy , be the large privately-owned coal firm in the US and the fourth-highest producer of the material in the country .  The 80-year-old have long advocate for government support for his industry — which employ about 80,000 people when the presidential baton be hand over but may have since halve during the Covid-19 pandemic — and be a strong critic of Obama , whose time in office he describe a “ eight year of pure hell ” .  “ We talk for 50 minute — I can talk , he can talk — about coal , about the connection between coal miner ’ job , coal miner ’ family .  ” So have label Trump ’ s election success a a “ wonderful victory ” , the day Murray Energy file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2019 be a key milestone in the downfall of coal .  Frontline War on the EPA ) Over the past decade , more than 50 coal company have go bankrupt and over 100 gigawatts ( GW ) of coal capacity have either retire or announce plan to retire a a drop in natural gas price and a surge in renewables have inflict a devastate blow on the fossil fuel ’ s future .  “ If you look at the state with high percentage of coal generation , it show that state with a diverse mix of fuel have some of the low price per kilowatt-hour for retail electricity .  ” Burke say that aside from electricity generation , metallurgical coal be “ key to steel production ” , which be “ critical to manufacturing and so many other industry ” .  The IEEFA claim the plant have “ much more go for it than most coal-fired plant in the US ” , of which many be “ far old , less efficient , and pay more to get their coal deliver ” .
***** ConclusionsCITING ARTICLES The article deal with the historical transition from coal to oil and natural gas , commonly refer to a hydrocarbon .  This transition occur throughout the industrialized world between the 1940s and 1970s , yet the cause for the shift from coal to hydrocarbon be only marginally understood .  Drawing from recent research on historical energy transition , we examine the takeover of hydrocarbon in the context of the incumbent coal configuration .  ( 1 ) the view on the overall energy supply system that diversify when hydrocarbon be introduce , and ( 2 ) that on the consumer of energy , who replace coal with hydrocarbon alternative .  The central argument be that the two perspective need to be integrate to fully understand why hydrocarbon could replace coal .  This monumental change in energy history be no simple shift in fuel , but a complex transition that occur at ( 1 ) the level of energy supply , where hydrocarbon become available a alternative to coal , and ( 2 ) the level of energy consumption , where consumer in the area of railway and maritime transportation , residential heating , industrial production , and electricity generation actively decide to use hydrocarbon alternative a substitution for coal .  energy transition , energy history , coal , oil , natural gas , fossil fuel , steam power , electricity , hydrocarbon , heating , air pollutionMots clés .  ” Within a relatively short period of time in the mid twentieth century , coal-based energy solution be largely replace with hydrocarbon alternative .  In term of relative share in primary energy supply in oecd country , coal go from sixty-two percent in 1940 to twenty-three percent in 1970 , while those of hydrocarbon ( oil and natural gas ) increase from twenty-six percent to almost seventy percent ( Figure 1 , see 397 hereafter ) .  The transition from coal to hydrocarbon in oecd country .  While much have be write on the rise of oil and gas , it be often overlook that hydrocarbon energy solution replace the exist coal-related technology and practice , such a coal oven and steam engine .  Recent study on historical transition have also emphasize that incumbent energy system , which coal be at the time , tend to be resistant to change .  a complex transition that occur both at the level of energy supply , where oil and natural gas become available a alternative to coal ; and at the level of energy consumption , where consumer in the area of railway and maritime transportation , residential heating , industrial production , and electricity generation actively decide to use hydrocarbon alternative a substitution for coal .  This mean that the transition from coal to hydrocarbon be only a relative transition in total primary energy supply , which triple between 1940 and 1970 , largely due to the increase of hydrocarbon , with oil grow from nine to sixty-eight exajoules and natural gas from three to twenty-eight ( Figure 1 ) .  This allow oil to be use for other purpose like residential heating and industrial production , where it have to compete with and replace coal , which it do from the late 1950s on owe to a price advantage .  30 As the literature on Europe show , the growth of hydrocarbon be not only due to the physical advantage of hydrocarbon over coal , increase availability and decline price , but also due to a rapidly grow demand for energy coincide with post-war economic growth , which coal could not meet alone .  The Consumption Perspective The transition from coal to hydrocarbon not only unfolded at the level of energy supply , but also in the sector where the fuel be consume .  During the late 1950s and 1960s , oil become cheap than coal , and it be more widely available , which allow for oil to compete with coal if fuel substitution be possible .  It be also a mean to address the grow demand for energy in time of rapid growth in the industrial sector , which coal alone could not meet .  The spread of hydrocarbon do not mean that coal lose it importance in the European energy mix , a it remain essential in some sector of industrial production and electricity generation .
***** Chinese First to Use Coal a an Energy Source `` According to the report of an early missionary to China , coal be already be burn there for heating and cooking , and have be so employ for up to 4000 year .

While he be CEO of Halliburton , they pay million of dollar in fine for provide false information on their company , just like Enron and Ken Lay .
***** navigation , search Halliburton be a multinational oil service and military contractor company find in 1919 , and headquarter in Dubai .
***** troop may have accept kickback from a Kuwaiti company subcontract to provide the service , and a $ 6 .  3 million check be be send to the Army unit oversee the contract .
***** 6 million , compare with 2 .  2 million when he enter office .  2 million in 1989 to about 1 .  66 Cheney be name in a December 2010 corruption complaint file by the Nigerian government against Halliburton , which the company settle for $ 250 million .
***** There be about 12 million of u who be eligible in that age cohort ; about 3 million have to go .  We kick it around a bit and a I recall , the way we leave it , I would call Sununu the next morning .  The other side of the coin be , what do I want to give up ? .  So there be a little bit of concern here too that we not get into a situation where Colin have leave the Army , go to the White House , and come back a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs .  We leave it that I would go reassure myself that Colin have in fact re-acclimated to the military and that there wouldn ’ t be a problem in this arena .
***** Halliburton give Dick Cheney a $ 34 million payout when he leave the company to join the presidential ticket .  When he get to be vice president , when he be sign for vice president , the oil company give him a $ 34 million sign bonus to become vice president of the United States .  We know he do n't mean that Cheney literally get a signing bonus for become the vice presidential candidate , a a newly sign free agent would in baseball .  But we think it be worth check whether Cheney do in fact end up with a $ 34 million payout when he step down as CEO to join Bush on the ticket in 2000 .  If he 'd wait until then to sell , his payday would have be one-third low , or roughly $ 14 million rather than $ 22 million .  But Cheney do appear to have have timing on his side , so we find Matthews ' statement -- that Cheney have a payday of $ 34 million -- to be accurate .

Leading the list be Altria Group ( the former Philip Morris ) , with just under $ 94 million in lobby expenditure .  6 million ) , follow by Lockheed Martin ( $ 71 .
***** The reality be that the US have cause destruction that destabilize an entire region , affect hundred of million of life .  Those who have no way of leave would have school bus escort them out of the city .  42 AM Jesse , I give President Bush , Republicans and even Democrats a fair chance to prove themselves worthy of govering u , but if you think that all journalism can be trust and facilitate the truth in democracy and freedom such a the story 9/11 and subsequent outbreak of war in Iraq , I find you quite naive .  A new administration would at least give u hope for peace , if , and maybe if , we can show them by example .  This administration response be DEAD wrong a far a I be concern and rather that win the war on terror we be just fan the flame , give justification to their hatred and fee our own irrational fear .
***** 5 million to script a film budget between $ 40 million- $ 50 million for Legendary and Universal Pictures .
***** When Vice President Dick Cheney leave office , his approval rating stand at a staggeringly low 13 percent .  In any case , it be beyond dispute that at Dick Cheney ’ s urging , the federal government spy on million of non-terrorist Americans without a warrant , and that Cheney want the program to continue even after it be declare illegal .  All tell , he would earn more than $ 44 million from Halliburton .  The use of foreign subsidiary may have help the company to avoid pay U .
***** What be useful about this movie be that it remind u that we live in world where only certain people matter and others be routinely and easily discard in horrific tortuous fashion very casually - yes we can point at Cheney in this movie but this reality be big than cheney or any one man or political party .  A million life be render hard to bare , on all side , and those be the survivor - survivor that live to be mentally destroy by the memory .

Nevertheless , the battle over the income tax reflect a fundamental clash of political philosophy that promise not only to dominate the upcoming five month of debate over the next budget , but also to carry over into the 2013 campaign , when Christie will be up for reelection along with all 80 Assembly member .  ” 10 percent tax table Christie , fresh off a triumphant Oprah Winfrey interview over the weekend , be clearly aim at a national court of public opinion as well .  Christie pointedly note that governor in Connecticut and New York have raise their top income tax rate , that California have propose to raise it top rate by up to two percentage point , and that Illinois have raise it income tax across-the-board , by 67 percent .  Under this tax cut , middle-class family don ’ t save enough for a week ’ s worth of grocery , while millionaire save enough to go on an exotic vacation .  If the governor want to cut a tax , let ’ s focus on find a way to chop property tax by 10 percent .  We choose responsible tax cut to give our overburdened citizen real relief .

The Republican Party , which have retake the House of Representatives the prior year , demand that President Obama negotiate over deficit reduction in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling , the statutory maximum of money the Treasury be allow to borrow .  The debt ceiling have routinely be raise in the past without partisan debate or additional term or condition .  This reflect the fact that the debt ceiling do not prescribe the amount of spending , but only ensure that the government can pay for the spending to which it have already commit itself .  If the United States breach it debt ceiling and be unable to resort to other `` extraordinary measure `` , the Treasury would have to either default on payment to bondholder or immediately curtail payment of fund owe to various company and individual that have be mandate but not fully fund by Congress .  On July 31 , two day prior to when the Treasury estimate the borrowing authority of the United States would be exhaust , Republicans agree to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for a complex deal of significant future spending cut .

***** Either one be in the camp that believe that the economy be automatically good off from tax change that benefit the wealthy , or one be in the camp that dismiss the whole thing a voodoo economics .  Foroohars aforementioned article point out that Americans do not mind pay tax , but instead mind if tax-paying be unfair ; Americans be pragmatic enough , in general , to consider long-term growth prospect a relevant in the definition of what be and isnt unfair .  One of the policy the Trump administration have proposedand similar policy have be propose directly by nearly every Republican administration since Ronald Reagan and indirectly perhaps by most Democratic administration since Jimmy Carteris to cut tax on the very wealthy .  The Hartz reform in Germany in 20032005 have a similar impact , although rather than low tax on wealthy Germans , these reform cause wage growth to slow relative to GDP growth , boost corporate profit by roughly 50 percent .  The argument in favor of cut tax on the very wealthy hinge on the impact this have on save and investment .  Desired and Actual Investment In order to understand the condition under which supply-side tax cut for the wealthy will lead to more growth or great unemployment , we must make a distinction between actual investment and desired investment .  The consequence of a tax cut on the wealthy be basically a transfer of wealth from average household to wealthy household , and if it be to generate high growth this transfer must sustainably increase demand in the form of high consumption or high investment .  If tax on the wealthy be cut with no change in fiscal expenditure , the net result be that the wealthy pay a small share of total expenditure , sowith the tax cutwealth be effectively transfer from average household to wealthy one .  Here be one of the great confusion that tend to mar nearly every discussion about the impact of tax cut on the wealthy .  As consumption decline , those who produce consumer good and service must cut back , and a they do so , they must fire worker .  Desired Investment Exceeds Actual Investment When it come to determine whether or not supply-side tax cut benefit the economy , the key be the relationship between desire investment and actual investment .  If desire investment exceed actual investment , trickle-down economics work , and everyone eventually can benefit from tax cut for the wealthy because they lead to an increase in productivity-enhancing investment that ensure that GDP growth in the future will be high than it otherwise would be .

Says Paul Ryans budget relies on the same $700 billion in savings from Medicare that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have been attacking Democrats about.
***** Looking to next year , House Republicans prepare a now-familiar budget feature futile gesture to block Obamacare and turn Medicare into a voucherlike program for future retiree .  Paul Ryans return to budget fantasyland If Rep .  Paul Ryan want people to take his budget manifesto seriously , he should be honest about his ambition .  If the plan Ryan offer have be enact , the federal budget would not come into balance until 2040 .  As he do in the campaign , Ryan attack Obama 's health reform for cut about $ 700 billion from Medicare over a decade , not by slash benefit but by reduce payment to provider .
***** “ Whether or not they [ the Romney campaign ] want to say that they have their own plan on Day One , or whatever they ’ re do , it doesn ’ t change the reality of them have to own the Ryan plan .  ” Another one say , “ The most popular phrase in Washington right now be .  ' ” The same consultant go on to say , “ If they win the battle to define Medicare , then I believe Romney win the presidency .  For the past six month , Republican strategist have be devise a campaign that be focus on run against the Obama economy and inoculate themselves on the Ryan budget because of Medicare .  “ [ M ] y plan for Medicare be very similar to his plan , which be ‘ Do not change the program for current retiree or near-retirees but do not do what the president have do and that be to cut $ 700 billion out of the current program .  Romney couldn ’ t name a difference with Ryan on Medicare -- until his campaign find out that Ryan ’ s budget contradict his top defense against the Democrats ’ Medicare attack ( “ Obama cut Medicare , too .

I accept the call of my generation to give our child the America that be give to u , with opportunity for the young and security for the old and I know that we be ready , Ryan say .  Ryan focus mostly on the fiscal issue that be the congressman strength , such a the national debt , stimulus spending under Obama and his propose Medicare reform , which have come under attack by Obama and Democrats .  He seek to turn the table on the issue , repeat the factually challenged assertion that Obama cut Medicare by more than $ 700 billion to cover the cost of the 2010 health care reform law pa by Democrats .  The figure come from a Jully 24 Congressional Budget Office report that say repeal the health care law , a call for by Romney and Ryan , would increase spending on Medicare by $ 716 billion through 2022 .  At the same time , the CBO letter say keep Obamacare in place would not mean a $ 716 billion decrease in Medicare spending , a claim by Ryan .
***** ” Indeed , television station in Pennsylvania , Illinois , and Kentucky have already refuse to run attack ad which be patently false .  Especially with respect to health care reform , energy reform , and budget and job issue , the common thread of deception be apparent .  However , FactCheck say that such contention be “ badly mislead ” a none of these assertion be accurate .  ” According to PolitiFact , health care reform do not cut $ 500 billion from Medicare , but do restrain “ the growth in Medicare spending by more than $ 500 billion over 10 year .  ” Therefore , Medicare benefit win ’ t be reduce , and the saving will come from cut in waste , restructure the program , and alteration in payment plan .  Many critic of reform say that the new law lead to “ government-run ” health care or the “ government takeover ” of health care .  FactCheck claim that “ there ’ s nothing in the legislation that support , require or even mention such prescription , ” and Political Correction say the charge be “ outrageously deceptive .  9 million new job , increase annual household income by $ 487- $ 1,175 per year , and boost GDP by $ 39- $ 111 billion .  ” Debt , Budget Deficits , and the Stimulus Plan Many ad by independent expenditure group suggest that Democrats in Congress and President Obama be almost-wholly responsible for the national debt and the budget deficit .

Paul Ryan ’ s budget plan , Ryan be the Republican nominee for vice president .  endorse or even comment on Ryan ’ s budget , which would partly remake Medicare into a voucher program for future senior while drastically cut most domestic spending .  “ I ’ m not go to get into a discussion now about a budget that may be pas next year with a new president and new Congress , ” Collins say .  All I ’ m say be that I ’ ll never support cut to Medicare for current senior or anyone close to retirement age , include Medicare Advantage , which my opponent have actually vote to cut .  “ Never should this country consider fundamentally change Medicare in order to finance tax break for millionaire and billionaire , ” a the Ryan spending plan would do , say Hochul , D-Hamburg .  but she say that ’ s exactly what Republicans be for in criticize the Medicare Advantage cut , which also be include in the Ryan budget .  “ Those cut be also in the Ryan budget .  In introduce Ryan on Saturday , Romney cite the same Medicare cut Collins complain about and then some , note that the total amount of future reduction to Medicare include in the Obama health care plan amount to $ 700 billion .
***** “ Unlike the current president who have cut Medicare fund by $ 700 billion , we will preserve and protect Medicare and Social Security , ” Romney say .

***** How often can you say that about a running mate ? .  Romney/Ryan , the ad go on to say , end Medicare a we know it .  As for deal with Medicare 's current money trouble , the Romney/Ryan force have be slam the $ 716 billion in save over the next decade that be agree to in President Obama 's health care reform law .  We also should n't cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare to the tune of some $ 700 billion .  He cut the payment that go to Medicare by $ 700 billion .  Here 's what he say .  He steal $ 700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare .  Congressman Ryan 's budget proposal this year and last year also preserve the Obamacare cut to Medicare that the congressman and Governor Romney be now campaign against .  People listen to both the governor and the congressman today might get the impression that they actually oppose the $ 700 billion cut .  And unlike the president 's plan , do n't put the saving back into the system .
***** Both campaign come out swing with new attack range from policy to personal .  Now when you need it , Obama have cut $ 716 billion from Medicare .  Now , Mitt Romney ’ s attack the president on Medicare ? .  many sweeping generalization about who he be , that he ’ s a tea party darling , that he ’ s a budget deficit hawk , that he ’ s small time boy from Janesville , Wisconsin .  They ’ ve explicitly say , I think in an interview with Politico , that .  one of the adviser say that we don ’ t want to put on a lot of detail there .
***** In an escalate struggle to seize the advantage on the contentious Medicare issue , the Romney campaign counterpunched with a new ad accuse Obama of cut more than $ 700 billion from the government-run health care plan for senior citizen .  Ryan be best-known for a conservative budget plan pass by the U .  House that include reform to partially privatize Medicare , which Democrats say will kill the popular entitlement program .  To counter consistent Democratic attack in recent day against Ryan ’ s Medicare proposal , the new Romney ad seek to turn the table by contend the money senior citizen have pay into Medicare for year will instead fund Obama ’ s 2010 health care reform bill .  “ When he run for office he say he ’ d protect Medicare , but do you know that he have take $ 716 billion out of the Medicare trust fund .  ” Romney say of Obama .  and if I ’ m president of the United States we ’ re put the $ 716 billion back .  ” A July 24 Congressional Budget Office report say that repeal the health care law , a call for by Romney and Ryan , would increase spending on Medicare by $ 716 billion through 2022 .  At the same time , the CBO letter say keep Obamacare in place would not mean a $ 716 billion decrease in Medicare spend a claim by Romney and his ad .  “ The save his ad attack do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit , and Mitt Romney embrace the very same saving when he promise he ’ d sign Paul Ryan ’ s budget , ” say Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith .  Standing in front of helmeted Ohio coal worker , Romney promise American energy independence by 2020 if he be elect to two term , say he will promote full development of the nation ’ s oil , coal and natural gas reserve .  Republicans reject the Democratic tactic to tie Romney to the Ryan proposal , say the former Massachusetts governor have his own budget and tax plan that be similar to Ryan ’ s but also include key difference , such a protect anyone over 55 from change to Medicare .
***** The House budget chairman also recount be a teenager in Wisconsin and have his grandmother move in with his family a she suffer from Alzheimer ’ s disease .  It ’ s what my grandma have , ” Ryan say .  And we have to keep that guarantee , ” Ryan say .  “ To make sure we can guarantee that promise for my mom ’ s generation , for those Baby Boomers who be retire every day , we must reform it for my generation , ” the 42-year-old Ryan say .

***** Well , in that same spirit , I say to President-elect Bush that what remain of partisan rancor must now be put aside , and may God bless his stewardship of this country .  `` As I begin , I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation , `` Bush say at the outset of his inaugural address .  `` We win that election , and they steal that election , `` McAuliffe say in a 2001 speech to the Democratic National Committee .  `` Long before he make the documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 challenge Bush 's reaction to the terrorist attack , filmmaker Michael Moore say in an interview , `` The majority of Americans never elect this guy in the White House .  And I 'll keep say that until he 's out of there .  Less than a year after the nation have be attack and Democrats and Republicans have sing God Bless America together on the Capitol lawn , the two side go at it tong and nail , with each side call into question the patriotism of the other .  Within nine month of take office , President Bush be afford the chance to unite the nation after the terrorist attack of September 11 , 2001 .  His crisis leadership , include insist on return to the White House the night of the attack instead of hole up in a safe bunker elsewhere , give the American people confidence that someone be in charge .

Many Democrats see the change to Medicare a a key attack point on the vice presidential pick and the Romney campaign .  `` This president stole -- he do n't cut Medicare -- he steal $ 700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare , `` Priebus say .  People who work with Ryan say he sometimes seem genuinely baffle and hurt when he believe his budget proposal be be misunderstand by the public , or intentionally distort by ideological foe .  That hasn ’ t happen , to say the least .  “ Paul be a substantive guy , and often the critique of his plan be either superficial or complete scare tactic , which tend to frustrate him , ” say one Republican operative close to Ryan .

Try refresh your browser , or Paul Ryan 's foreign policy , national security experience 'thin ' , Democrats say Back to video Ryan ’ s focus on domestic issue and his reputation a a rather wonky budget hawk confirm that Romney see the November contest with President Barack Obama a a referendum over the U .  economy and the size of the federal budget .

***** ” Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan have rule out close this costly and lopsided loophole Read more In a recent paper ass the likely impact of President Obama and Mitt Romneys budget plan if they become law , we apply standard macroeconomic multiplier to estimate of each plan ’ s fiscal impulse .  But , what drive our result in determine whose budget plan provide a big economic boost be simply the relative ranking of these multiplier ; specifically the estimate that tax cut ( particularly for high-income household ) provide less dollar-for-dollar economic support than do spend increase .  Instead , most policy attention in the race center on which candidate would more rapidly reduce project budget deficits—a policy maneuver that , in the next couple of year , would be all but guarantee to lead to high unemployment rate .  present ) , when federal budget policy pivot sharply toward austerity .  Republicans have clearly lead the charge away from Keynesianism , vociferously decry the increase in budget deficit since the Great Recession begin and demand a dollar of spending cut for every dollar increase in the statutory debt ceiling .
***** Ryan ’ s budget blueprint assume the same amount of Medicare save a President Obama ’ s health care law , even though Mitt Romney and Mr .  Ryan have say those cut would be devastate to million of old Americans on Medicare .  As the partisan brawl over Medicare continue on Tuesday and threaten to become the focus of the race , the Obama campaign say that Mr .  Ryan ’ s budget plan — broadly endorse by Mr .  “ You pay into Medicare for year , every paycheck , ” the advertisement say .  “ Now when you need it , Obama have cut $ 716 billion from Medicare .  Obama would use the saving to help offset the cost of cover the uninsured , as well a to improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund .  ” The Ryan plan , like any budget resolution , specifies level of spending , save and revenue , base on certain policy assumption .
***** WHEN Paul Ryan release his propose federal budget a year ago , Mitt Romney greet it coolly .  Mr Ryan 's budget be political dynamite .  By December he be attack Mr Gingrich for criticise it , and this past February he release a new tax plan of his own that slash all personal tax rate by 20 % .  And when Mr Ryan produce a new , very similar , version of his budget on March 20th for next fiscal year , Mr Romney be effusive .  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , give Mr Romney some credit for his promised spending cut , say his plan would send the national debt up to 96 % of GDP by 2021 from 73 % this year ; it would reach only 76 % under Mr Obama 's late budget .
***** There be two way to assess Mitt Romney 's decision to attack traditional Medicare and talk up the merit of partial privatization .  For instance , the Kaiser Family Foundation say in a February survey that 70 percent of Americans ( and 71 percent of swing-voting independent ) want to keep Medicare a it be ; only 25 percent ( and 24 percent of swing voter ) support partial privatization .  And last year , after the House pa Ryan 's budget plan , the ABC News-Washington Post poll say that 65 percent oppose the idea of a voucher program , and that opposition swell to 85 percent when people be tell the voucher would n't cover all medical care .  Denny Rehberg , the GOP senatorial candidate in Montana , have air an ad attack Ryan 's budget plan .
***** How could anyone who claim to be so very worried about the crush federal debt blithely renounce $ 700 billion in save ? .  While Ryan 's new budget assume that Obamacare go away , it also assume that the tax increase on high earner approve in the fiscal cliff deal remain in place .
***** Many commentator swoon earlier this week after House Republicans , lead by the Budget Committee chairman , Paul Ryan , unveil their budget proposal .  Well , they should have wait until people who know how to read budget number have a chance to study the proposal .  budget plan isn ’ t a good-faith effort to put America ’ s fiscal house in order ; it ’ s voodoo economics , with an extra dose of fantasy , and a large help of mean-spiritedness .  Until now the attack of the fiscal phony have be mainly a national rather than a state issue , with Paul Ryan , the chairman of the House Budget Committee , a the prime example .  Ryan have somehow acquire a reputation a a stern fiscal hawk despite offer budget proposal that , far from be focus on deficit reduction , be mainly about cut tax for the rich while slash aid to the poor and unlucky .  The same can be say of Mitt Romney , who claim that he will balance the budget but whose actual proposal consist mainly of huge tax cut ( for corporation and the wealthy , of course ) plus a promise not to cut defense spending .  And the evidence for their fakery isn ’ t just their bad arithmetic ; it ’ s the fact that for all their allege deep concern over budget gap , that concern isn ’ t sufficient to induce them to give up anything — anything at all — that they and their financial backer want .
***** I serve 12 year represent Pennsylvania in the United States Senate , but I also have substantial executive experience make the tough decision and balance budget and cut spending .  I say about 30 second , because we 're on the honor system tonight , no bell , no whistle .  Gingrich say that 14 million people be unemployed .  The Democrats say that the Republicans do n't have any plan to create job , and job -- and job in the private sector , not in the government job .  And , Senator Santorum , you mention -- you say you have executive experience , as well a your Senate experience .  Some economist say he have some unrealistic expectation , and he say you could grow the economy 5 percent a year , then 5 percent a year , then 5 percent a year .  Governor Pawlenty , answer the critic -- and a you do so -- who say 5 percent every year be just unrealistic .  Speaker , if you look at a poll in the Boston Globe just the other day , 54 percent of Republican voter in this state say they 're willing to have high tax on the wealthy to help bring down the deficit .  The Reagan recovery , which I participate in passing , in seven year create for this current economy the equivalent of 25 million new job , raise federal revenue by $ 800 billion a year in term of the current economy , and clearly it work .  The speaker just say , Congresswoman , repeal Dodd-Frank .  Answer the American out there who say maybe I do n't like all of the detail , but after what happen in 2007 and 2008 , I do n't want Wall Street to not have somebody look at them , watch what they 're do .
***** Paul Ryan ( R-WI ) disagree about $ 700 billion in Medicare reduction include in the Affordable Care Act ( aka .  To begin , it be undeniable that Congressional Democrats and the Obama White House choose to pay for nearly half the cost of the ACA by reduce Medicare 's expected rate of growth by about $ 450 billion between 2010 and 2019 .  During the Senate and House debate on the ACA in 2009 and 2010 , Congressional Republicans pillory Democrats for cut Medicare $ 500 billion to finance ObamaCare .  In the spring of 2011 , the new Republican House majority vote overwhelmingly in favor of the budget proposal advance by the new House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan .
***** Three day later , President Barack Obama repeat his own pledge to preserve the program , propose a part of his 2013 budget plan to reduce spending growth by about $ 300 billion over 10 year , but keep intact it guarantee , specify benefit .  “ What I will not support be effort to turn Medicare into a voucher , ” the president write in his budget .  While young and middle-age voter be more focused on the economy , “ senior be single-issue voter when it come to Social Security and Medicare , ” say Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg , senior vice president of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner .  Republicans win control of the House in 2010 in large part after hammer the president and his party for a health care law that they say cut $ 500 billion from Medicare over 10 year .  But those vote could be up for grab after nearly every House Republican , lead by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , vote for a plan last year that build on the health care law ’ s $ 500 billion in spending reduction and go much far .  Supporting the Ryan-Wyden compromise have remove the “ bull ’ s eye ” target from Romney ’ s back that “ Democrats have plan to use , ” since he would preserve traditional fee-for-service Medicare for those who want it , say Gail Wilensky , a campaign adviser to 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain , and head of the Medicare program in the George H .  The president say he want to preserve Medicare ’ s current guarantee to cover set benefit , but curb cost through great efficiency , such a strengthen incentive for doctor , hospital and other health care provider to give high-quality care , and cut expenditure for those who get care through the Medicare Advantage program .

***** 4 EmailSave/Print Analysis of the wealth hold by white , black , and Hispanic household point to difference in save behavior , notably a disinclination on the part of minority household to invest in risky , higher-yielding financial asset .  This finding may account for some of the great disparity in wealth across racial and ethnic group that can not be explain by income and demographic factor .  Summary White household in the United States be far wealthy than black or Hispanic household , a disparity that remain unexplained even after take into account income and demographic factor .  This article use data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine various component of aggregate wealth , include housing equity , nonhousing equity , financial asset in general , and risky asset in particular .  It inspect asset choice by race and ethnicity and as whether difference in save behavior -- and , consequently , in rate of return on asset -- be possible source of the wealth gap .  It also demonstrate the equalize effect of pension wealth and Social Security wealth on total wealth .  At every income quartile and educational level , the percentage of black and Hispanic household that own risky , higher-yielding asset be considerably small than the percentage of white household .  Thus , some of the wealth gap appear to be attributable to difference in save behavior .  Lower rate of investment in the financial market will probably result in slow wealth creation in minority household .  This be a positive step toward narrow the wealth divide .  In 1984 , the early year for which such data be available , 73 percent of white age 65 or old receive income from asset , compare with 31 percent of black and 38 percent of Hispanics .  1 That gap have persist , with 1998 data show that 69 percent of old white have income from asset , compare with 26 percent of black and 33 percent of Hispanics .

The median wealth of a white family in 2009 be 20 time great than that of the average black family , and 18 time great than the average Hispanic family .  In other word , the average white family have $ 113,149 in net worth , compare to $ 6,325 for Hispanics and $ 5,677 for black .  Real Estate Downturn Rakesh Kochhar , one of the author of the report , say white household go into the recession in a much strong position and , a a result , be well able to weather the storm .  Minority family have most of their wealth in their home , so when the housing bubble burst , Kochhar say , those household take a big hit .

Among lower-income family , the gap between white household and their black and Hispanic counterpart shrink by about half from 2007 to 2016 .  But among middle-class family , it increase and show no sign of retreat .  ( There be an insufficient number of observation in the SCF data to report on upper-income black and Hispanic family separately .  Overall , American household wealth have not fully recover from the Great Recession .  In 2016 , the median wealth of all U .  household be $ 97,300 , up 16 % from 2013 but well below median wealth before the recession begin in late 2007 ( $ 139,700 in 2016 dollar ) .  And even though overall racial and ethnic inequality in wealth narrow from 2013 to 2016 , the gap remain large .  In 2016 , the median wealth of white household be $ 171,000 .  2Lower-income white family experience great loss in wealth during the recession than lower-income black and Hispanic family do .  Overall , black and Hispanic family be more likely than white family to have zero net worth or to be in debt .  Consequently , the recession drive wealth inequality between upper-income family and lower- and middle-income family to the high level record .  Moreover , the median wealth of upper-income white family in 2016 be 25 % great than it pre-recession level , an increase great than for all upper-income family combine .  In 2016 , upper-income white family have six time a much wealth a middle-income white family , compare with four time a much prior to the recession .
***** Although the term `` racial wealth gap `` technically refer to the difference in asset own by different racial or ethnic group , this gap result from a range of economic factor that affect the overall economic well-being of these different group .

Data from the Federal Reserve Boards 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances show that White family have great wealth than other racial group , with Black family and Hispanic family have the least .  At middle and old age , for example , the median wealth of White family be four to six time great than the median wealth of Black family .  White family with an unemployed head of household have almost double the wealth of Black family with a fully employ head of household , accord to a 2017 article in the Federal Reserve Bank of St .  Specific government policy and societal discrimination have fee into the creation of a gap , but it also important to consider general trend of wealth accumulation over time .  Other factor Education have historically influence the creation of a wealth gap , as well .

***** The root of the racial wealth divide can be find in racist policy and practice date back to our nation ’ s early day .  Under the institution of chattel slavery , enslave Africans be valuable asset whose labor generate wealth for their white owner .  After emancipation , black work a landless tenant farmer and sharecropper .  They be also largely shut out of the Homestead Acts , through which the federal government give approximately 246 million acre to homesteader — land that be the original source of family wealth for about one-quarter of the US adult population by 2004 .  Housing be a key area in which both public policy and private action clearly advantage white .  From 1934 to 1968 , the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) finance mortgage to expand homeownership , but also deliberately create segregate white neighborhood to keep out “ incompatible racial element [ s ] .  ” [ 13 ] Federal policy also harm black neighborhood by exclude many resident of these area from eligibility for government-backed loan and mortgage and discourage lending to people of color by designate their neighborhood a bad credit risk .  [ 14 ] These practice help white build asset , reduce home value in non-white neighborhood , and push would-be homebuyers of color into predatory land contract that systematically strip wealth from their community .  [ 17 ] Today , housing discrimination remain a barrier for people of color , who be recommend and show few housing unit than be equally qualified white .  [ 30 ] Back to Top Key Factors Contributing to the Growing Wealth Divide Many factor be drive the growth of the racial wealth gap .

***** Politics Govt Search A close examination of wealth in the U .  At $ 171,000 , the net worth of a typical white family be nearly ten time great than that of a Black family ( $ 17,150 ) in 2016 .  Gaps in wealth between Black and white household reveal the effect of accumulated inequality and discrimination , as well a difference in power and opportunity that can be trace back to this nation ’ s inception .  The Black-white wealth gap reflect a society that have not and do not afford equality of opportunity to all it citizen .  Assistant Vice President for Applied Research in Community Development - Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Twitter ryandnunn Efforts by Black Americans to build wealth can be trace back throughout American history .  This history matter for contemporary inequality in part because it legacy be pass down generation-to-generation through unequal monetary inheritance which make up a great deal of current wealth .  In 2020 Americans be project to inherit about $ 765 billion in gift and bequest , exclude wealth transfer to spouse and transfer that support minor child .  In fact , the ratio of white family wealth to Black family wealth be high today than at the start of the century .  Why be high- and middle-income white family so much wealthy than Black family with the same income ? .  Black family who make it to the top of the income distribution in a particular year be more likely than white family to drop out of the top in subsequent year , and their respective wealth level reflect this difference .
***** Hsu with assistance from Julia Hewitt1 New data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances ( SCF ) show that long-standing and substantial wealth disparity between family in different racial and ethnic group be little change since the last survey in 2016 ; the typical White family have eight time the wealth of the typical Black family and five time the wealth of the typical Hispanic family .  This FEDS Note explore pattern in wealth holding by race and ethnicity , as well a some key issue relate to the accumulation of wealth , use new data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances ( SCF ) .  We first analyze total wealth among family classify , accord to their self-identification during the interview , a White non-Hispanic , Black or African American non-Hispanic , Hispanic or Latino , and other or multiple race ( we will henceforth refer to these group a White , Black , Hispanic , and other , respectively ) .  2 Wealth be define a the difference between family ' gross asset and their liability .  In the 2019 survey , White family have the high level of both median and mean family wealth .  Black and Hispanic family have considerably less wealth than White family .  Black family ' median and mean wealth be less than 15 percent that of White family , at $ 24,100 and $ 142,500 , respectively .  Hispanic family ' median and mean wealth be $ 36,100 and $ 165,500 , respectively .  Other families—a diverse group that include those identify a Asian , American Indian , Alaska Native , Native Hawaiian , Pacific Islander , other race , and all respondent report more than one racial identification—have lower wealth than White family but high wealth than Black and Hispanic family .  The same pattern of inequality in the distribution of wealth across all family be also evident within race/ethnicity group ; for each of the four race/ethnicity group , the mean be substantially high than the median , reflect the concentration of wealth at the top of the wealth distribution for each group .  White family have more wealth than Black , Hispanic , and other or multiple race family in the 2019 SCF .  Figures display median ( top panel ) and mean ( bottom panel ) wealth by race and ethnicity , express in thousand of 2019 dollar .  Accessible version The SCF data provide a snapshot of family ' wealth at a point in time .  That say , the faster growth in wealth for Black and Hispanic family only result in modest change in the gap in wealth between these family and White family .  For example , amongst family under 35 , White family have between $ 11,900 and $ 24,800 more in median wealth than Black , Hispanic , or other family .  With respect to the Black-White gap at middle and old age , the median wealth of White family be four to six time great than the median wealth of Black family .  For these reason , wealth ( or a lack thereof ) can persist across generation and reflect , among other factor , a legacy of discrimination or unequal treatment in housing , education , and labor market .  White family be substantially more likely to receive inheritance , gift and other family support than Black and Hispanic family Source .

The likely outcome of this combination could be an increase in income inequality that be bear in large part by minority community .  But until we see how this recession play out and the nature of the eventual recovery , we will not know if this rise in inequality will be a temporary blip or a slide onto a longer negative trajectory .  It start with an uneven playing field Income and wealth inequality in the United States have be on the rise since the early 1970s,7 and even prior to the pandemic it show no sign of abate .
***** Evidence to date suggest that black and Hispanic worker face much more economic and health insecurity from COVID-19 than white worker .

***** But the last half-decade have prove far bad for black and Hispanic family than for white family , starkly widen the already large gulf in wealth between non-Hispanic white Americans and most minority group , accord to a new study from the Urban Institute .  “ It be already dismal , ” Darrick Hamilton , a professor at the New School in New York , say of the wealth gap between black and white household .  ” Given the dynamic of the housing recovery and the rebound in the stock market , the wealth gap might still be grow , expert say , further dim the prospect for economic advancement for current and future generation of Americans from minority group .  The Urban Institute study find that the racial wealth gap yawn during the recession , even a the income gap between white Americans and nonwhite Americans remain stable .  As of 2010 , white family , on average , earn about $ 2 for every $ 1 that black and Hispanic family earn , a ratio that have remain roughly constant for the last 30 year .  But when it come to wealth — a measure by asset , like cash saving , home and retirement account , minus debt , like mortgage and credit card balance — white family have far outpace black and Hispanic one .  Before the recession , non-Hispanic white family , on average , be about four time a wealthy a nonwhite family , accord to the Urban Institute ’ s analysis of Federal Reserve data .  ” Many expert consider the wealth gap to be more pernicious than the income gap , a it perpetuate from generation to generation and have a powerful effect on economic security and mobility .  Black family also be hit disproportionately by the housing collapse , because head into the recession housing constitute a high proportion of their wealth than for white family , leave them more exposed when the market crash .  Even if black and Hispanics make progress in the year ahead a the economy improve , the persistence of the wealth gap have push many public policy scholar to recommend the adoption of more ambitious program to help reduce worsen inequality .

( Getty/Gary Waters ) Wealth—the measure of an individual ’ s or family ’ s financial net worth—provides all sort of opportunity for American family .  Importantly , it be the most complete measure of a family ’ s future economic well-being .  After all , family rely on their wealth to pay their bill if their regular income disappears during an unemployment spell or after retire , for instance .  Unfortunately , wealth in this country be unequally distribute by race—and particularly between white and black1 household .  2 African American family have a fraction of the wealth of white family , leave them more economically insecure and with far few opportunity for economic mobility .  As this report document , even after consider positive factor such a increased education level , African Americans have less wealth than white .  Less wealth translate into few opportunity for upward mobility and be compound by low income level and few chance to build wealth or pa accumulate wealth down to future generation .  Several key factor exacerbate this vicious cycle of wealth inequality .  A well-documented history of mortgage market discrimination mean that black be significantly less likely to be homeowner than whites,3 which mean they have less access to the saving and tax benefit that come with own a home .  Persistent labor market discrimination and segregation also force black into few and less advantageous employment opportunity than their white counterpart .  Indeed , Hispanic family have only slightly more wealth than black family .  This report focus solely on wealth , which be substantially more concentrated among America ’ s richest household than income , and thus leave many households—especially black households—economically insecure .  Wealth be more concentrated than income , and it concentration have grow for both black and white .  ( see Table 1 ) The Great Recession do great damage to black wealth than it do to white wealth , widen the racial wealth gap even far over the past decade .
***** The persistent racial wealth gap in the United States be a burden on Black Americans as well a the overall economy .  The United States have spend the past century expand it economic power , and it show in American family wealth .  Despite income stagnation outside the circle of high earner , median family wealth grow from $ 83,000 in 1992 to $ 97,000 in 2016 ( in 2016 dollar ) .  Beyond the overall growth in top-line number , however , the growth in household wealth ( define a net worththe net value of each family liquid and illiquid asset and debt ) have not be inclusive .  In wealth , black individual , family , and community tend to lag behind their white counterpart .  Indeed , the median white family have more than ten time the wealth of the median black family in 2016 ( Exhibit 1 ) .  In fact , the racial wealth gap between black and white family grow from about $ 100,000 in 1992 to $ 154,000 in 2016 , in part because white family gain significantly more wealth ( with the median increasing by $ 54,000 ) , while median wealth for black family do not grow at all in real term over that period .  com The widen racial wealth gap disadvantage black family , individual , and community and limit black citizen economic power and prospect , and the effect be cyclical .  almost 70 percent of middle-class black child be likely to fall out of the middle class a adult .

We model economic outcome for the United States under two distinct scenario to measure the impact on GDP that would result from close the wealth gap over the 201928 time frame and used income , tangible investment , and stock-market investment a component of wealth in our model .  In the first scenario ( the optimist scenario ) , we estimate the effect of narrow the wealth gap between black and white Americans from it 2016 level .  We calculate the economic effect by assume that each group wealth continue to grow at their 19892016 rate ( 0 .  Unsurprisingly , the barrier to wealth building for black family be numerous enough to merit in-depth exploration , so we have dedicate this report to understand the piece of black Americans financial life that add up to significantly less than those of their white peer .  Indeed , the public , private , and social sector will need to contribute to rectify structural inequity that contribute to the racial wealth gap .  6 time more likely than white and Hispanic family to live in area of concentrated poverty .
***** Economists have describe the uneven and unequal economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession a a “ K-shaped ” recovery , characterize by divergent recovery trajectory for the affluent relative to those of less mean .  While considerable attention have be devote to examine the preexisting disparity in labor market outcomes that leave some household more vulnerable than others to the COVID-19 recession , less attention have be pay to the role of wealth in determine a household ’ s ability to buffer the pandemic ’ s economic shock .  In particular , income from wealth be tax at much low rate than income from work , and wealth can serve a a source of save to absorb temporary setback such a a loss of employment income .  A previous Hamilton Project analysis reveal stagger inequality in wealth hold by white versus Black household .  Using update data from the Survey of Consumer Finances ( SCF ) for 2019 , we find that the Black-white wealth gap persist head into the COVID-19 pandemic , leave Black household with far few resource to weather the storm .  Wealth Inequality Preceding COVID-19 In 2019 the median white household hold $ 188,200 in wealth—7 .  8 time that of the typical Black household ( $ 24,100 ; figure 1 ) .  It be worth note that level of average wealth , which be more heavily skew by household with the great amount of wealth , be high .  white household report average wealth of $ 983,400 , which be 6 .  9 time that of Black household ( $ 142,500 ; SCF ) .  The Black-white wealth gap serve a an important factor in understand how economic recovery can become uneven and unequal across demographic .  The Intersection of the Black-white and Gender Wealth Gaps In addition to the Black-white wealth gap , a gender wealth gap ( and it intersection with race ) reveal another dimension of wealth inequality .  6 time great than that of single Black men ( $ 1,550 ) , and 224 .

Similar to McAllister , many other Black family be feel the stress of today 's pandemic compound with the linger effect of the 2008 crisis .
***** Go to find 1Median Black and Hispanic family earn roughly 70 cent in take-home income for every dollar earn by White family , and racial gap in earnings be large for higher-income and old account holder .  Go to find 4Across geography , the financial outcome of Hispanic family vary the most , while the financial outcome of Black family vary the least .  Go to find 5After involuntary job loss , Black and Hispanic family cut their everyday spending more so than White family , difference that be explain by racial gap in liquid and financial asset buffer .  Go to find 6Upon receipt of a tax refund , Black and Hispanic family increase their expenditure more so than White family , difference that be explain by racial gap in liquid and financial asset buffer .  Even amidst strong macroeconomic condition , family experience high level of income volatility that have important implication for well-being .  Previous JPMorgan Chase Institute research have show that family cut consumption on everyday necessity when they experience job loss , and delay spending on healthcare and durable purchase until their tax refund arrive .  Upon receipt of a tax refund , Black and Hispanic family increase their expenditure more so than White family , difference that be explain by racial gap in liquid and financial asset buffer .  The private , nonprofit , and government sector all have important role to play a policymakers , service provider , and employer in close racial gap in income and wealth .
***** Yet , even before the recession , labor market outcome for black be substantially bad than for white , a evidence across a wide range of economic data .  Income $ 39,715 At the median , black family make $ 39,715 in 2010 , down from about $ 44,000 in 2000 .  As a percentage of white median family income , black make 61 percent in 2010 , down from 63 .  1 % The Great Recession wreak havoc on household income for black .  2010 , the median black household ’ s income fell 10 .  4 percent for white household .
***** Most study of the persistent gap in wealth between white and black have investigate the large gap in income earn by the two group .  Those study generally conclude that the wealth gap be “ too big ” to be explain by difference in income .  We study the issue use a different approach , capture the dynamic of wealth accumulation over time .  We find that the income gap be the primary driver behind the wealth gap and that it be large enough to explain the persistent difference in wealth accumulation .  The key policy implication of our work be that policy design to speed the closing of the racial wealth gap would do well to focus on close the racial income gap .  Black household in the United States have , on average , considerably less wealth than white household .  In 2016 , the average wealth of household with a head identify a black be $ 140,000 , while the corresponding level for white-headed household be $ 901,000 , nearly 6 .  1 The fact that black , on average , have considerably less wealth than white be trouble , not just because it be an inequality of outcome , but also because it strongly suggest inequality of opportunity .  The economic opportunity provide by wealth range from insure consumption against disruption to a household disposable income ( such a surprise medical expenditure or unemployment spell ) to enable access to housing , good public school , and postsecondary education .  Given the importance of wealth and the persistence of racial inequality in the United States , economist have have a long-standing interest in the racial wealth gap .  We then present new research show that although difference in save rate , inheritance , and rate of return on investment have all be suspect a play a large role in maintain the racial wealth gap , the gap be primarily the result of a sizeable and persistent income gap .  The Great Recession have a large impact on average black wealth than on white wealth .  Third , other factor we might have suspect a play major role in maintain the racial wealth gap pale in comparison to the role of the labor income gap .  While our study be only one contribution in the broad literature on the racial wealth gap , our analysis support the conclusion that the racial labor income gap be the primary driver behind the large and persistent difference in average wealth between black and white household .
***** The recession , while painful for everyone , be especially disastrous for black Americans .  Now a report from the ACLU say that black family will continue to suffer the effect of this disproportionately for decade to come .  By 2031 , white household wealth will be 31 percent below what it would ’ ve be have the recession never happen , accord to the report .  For black household , wealth will be 40 percent low , which will leave black family about $ 98,000 poor than if the recession hadn ’ t take place .  This be particularly worrying because black household have always trail significantly behind their white counterpart when it come to wealth accumulation , and recession expand that gap .  In 2013 , the net worth of white household be 13 time great than that of black household , the large the gap have be since 1989 , accord to Pew Research .  Wealth often determine not only how well family can provide for themselves when it come to basic like food and shelter , but it be a safety net for emergency and help to set up future generation for education , home ownership , and other opportunity that improve people ’ s life .  A big part of the reason that the recession hit black Americans so hard be that it gutted home value , and home ownership be a much more significant part of the group ’ s overall wealth .
***** Although the number of uninsured have likely increase far in 2020 , the data from 2019 provide an important baseline for understand change in health coverage lead up to the pandemic .  Most uninsured people have at least one worker in the family .  Families with low income be more likely to be uninsured .  Reflecting the more limited availability of public coverage in some state , adult be more likely to be uninsured than child .  Studies repeatedly demonstrate that uninsured people be less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and service for major health condition and chronic disease .  In 2019 , uninsured nonelderly adult be over twice as likely a those with private coverage to have have problem pay medical bill in the past 12 month .
***** Nine Charts about Wealth Inequality in America ( Updated ) Why hasnt wealth inequality improve over the past 50 year ? .  And why , in particular , have the racial wealth gap not close ? .  These nine chart illustrate how income inequality , earnings gap , homeownership rate , retirement saving , student loan debt , and lopsided asset-building subsidy have contribute to these grow wealth disparity .  Average wealth have increase over the past 50 year , but it have not grow equally for all group .  Between 1963 and 2016 , family near the bottom of the wealth distribution ( those at the 10th percentile ) go from have no wealth on average to be about $ 1,000 in debt , those in the middle more than double their wealth , family near the top ( at the 90th percentile ) saw their wealth increase fivefold , and the wealth of those at the 99th percentilein other word , those wealthy than 99 percent of all familiesgrew sevenfold .  These change have increase wealth inequality significantly .  In 1963 , family near the top have six time the wealth ( or , $ 6 for every $ 1 ) of family in the middle .  By 2016 , they have 12 time the wealth of family in the middle .  Income difference narrow when all tax and transferssuch a health insurance and in-kind government benefitsare include , but private wealth do not change .  Both measure be important because average wealth indicate how a group be prosper a a whole relative to other group , while median wealth show how the typical family be do .  By 2016 , the average wealth of white family ( $ 919,000 ) be over $ 700,000 high than the average wealth of black family ( $ 140,000 ) and of Hispanic family ( $ 192,000 ) .  Put another way , white family wealth be seven time great than black family wealth and five time great than Hispanic family wealth in 2016 .  White family accumulate more wealth over their life than black or Hispanic family do , widen the wealth gap at old age .  in 1989 , white family have about $ 25,000 more ( or five time more ) in average retirement save than black and Hispanic family .  White family be five time more likely than black family to receive large gift or inheritance , which can be use to pay for college .
***** Public attention have focus mostly on racial and ethnic disparity in income , but racial and ethnic disparity in wealth .  Gaps in wealth be particularly important for household with child because wealth play a key role in child 's life chance , which make racial and ethnic gap in wealth all the more alarming .  Importantly , broaden gap be likely to be persistent over time a wealth be pass down across generation through inheritance , contribution to college tuition , and more .  Studying wealth gap among family with child reveals not only inequalities in these family ’ current situation but also suggest inequality in how their child will fare in the future .  However , study of wealth inequality have not tend to focus specifically on difference in wealth by race and ethnicity among family with child .  When we focus on this group , we find that racial and ethnic gap in wealth be large for family with child compare to racial wealth gap in the general population .  Our research depict the extreme wealth fragility of black child household .  Black household with child have just one cent of wealth for every dollar of wealth for white household with child in 2016 .  Children from the least wealthy family be six time less likely to graduate from college than child from the wealthy family .

Keywords wealth , inequality , race , childrenThe United States be in the midst of an ongoing conversation about how to redress the consequence of slavery and discrimination and ameliorate current racial/ethnic inequality across many domain , include household wealth .  The Great Recession , from 2007 to 2009 , lead to a sharp uptick in racial/ethnic wealth inequality , and the economic recovery have be uneven , further harden racial/ethnic disparity in wealth ( Bricker et al .  In this article , we argue that racial gap in wealth be large than be realize for a key population of sociological and public policy interest .  Because there be a rich body of research on racial/ethnic wealth inequality among the total population ( inclusive of child household and childless household ) , we start with an overview of what be know about racial/ethnic difference in household wealth for the total population and the mechanism that produce these inequality .  Beyond home ownership , education debt be arguably the most important factor in racial/ethnic inequality in wealth ( Addo , Houle , and Simon 2016 ; Killewald and Bryan 2018 ) .

Congress should expand the rate of the Alternative Simplified Credit for research from 14 percent to at least 25 percent .  The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy ( OSTP ) should craft a national research roadmap for key productivity-enhancing technology .  OSTP should task all federal agency that fund research with conduct an analysis of where their research investment can have the large impact on productivity .  4 percent a year ( a rate similar to the one enjoyed in the 1960s when federal R & D be a much high share of GDP than today ) , this rate would add $ 1 .

Guaranteeing all worker at least one week of pay sick leave would do much to help low-income work family and their child .  In New Mexico , however , only half of private-sector worker have access to pay sick leave .  1 New Mexico , with it high percentage of low-wage job and a correspondingly high rate of work family who be low-income , would have much to gain from enact pay leave legislation .

It be encourage to see the federal government initiate talk with the province to look at implement 10 day of pay sick leave across the country after pressure to take action come from other leader , include BC ’ s premier and the federal NDP leader .

This be likely drive by the industrial difference in regional economy , a employer in good produce industry like forestry , mining , construction and manufacturing be less likely to provide pay sick leave ( even to middle- and higher-paid worker ) than employer in service-producing industry .

In Cleveland , why be there thousand of provisional ballot disqualify when everyone know that poll worker have give faulty instruction to the voter ? .  President , I find it almost impossible to believe that I be actually stand on the floor of the Senate today engage in a debate over whether George Bush win Ohio in the 2004 Presidential election .  Because I be limit under the rule to 5 minute , I will not have time to address all of the wild , incoherent , and completely unsubstantiated charge that have be make about the 2004 Ohio Presidential election .  The election horse be dead .

Not one shred of evidence have be present to show that Ohios strictly bipartisan system of run election be manipulate .  Kerry understand that George Bush legitimately win the election , which be why he concede on November 3rd .  Those who claim that Ohios vote be rig have produce nothing that approach credible evidence , nor have they explain how a conspiracy could be carry out successfully in a decentralized system involve 88 separate , bipartisan county election board .

***** Introduction Provisional ballot ensure that voter be not exclude from the voting process due to an administrative error .  Also refer to a “ challenge ballot ” or “ affidavit ballot ” in some state , they be require by the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 ( HAVA ) .  When there be uncertainty about a voter ’ s eligibility—the potential voter ’ s name be not on the voter roll , a required identification document isn ’ t available or other issues—the election official be require to offer the voter a provisional ballot instead of a regular ballot .  In nearly all of the state , after be cast , the provisional ballot be keep separate from other ballot until after the election .  A determination be then make a to whether the voter be eligible to vote , and therefore whether the ballot be to be count .  Generally , a board of election or local election official will investigate the provisional ballot within day of the election .  Since this be an additional administrative step , a large number of provisional ballot can increase cost for jurisdiction .  States vary greatly in how provisional ballot be handle and in the number that be issue and reject , and both the process and the data be track by the U .  States can have a few a 100 provisional ballot cast statewide , or as many a 100,000 .  Often standard for handle provisional ballot be determine by state law .
***** Johnny Kauffman Rachel Sender for APM ReportsVoter registration deadline have long be a part of American election , but an APM Reports investigation find that they disenfranchise a surprising number of voter in 2018 .  15 percent — the close House race in the country .  In the week before the election , an Atlanta Journal Constitution story dub the county `` ground zero in the fight over alleged voter suppression in Georgia .  Immediately after the election , Democrats speculate that voter suppression tactic have aid Woodall .  Election official have also throw out absentee ballot at far high rate than most other part of the state .  Bourdeauxs campaign begin examine discard ballot and call people whose ballot have be reject to let them know they could still verify a signature or show an ID to have their vote count .  Except the discarded ballot couldnt account for her loss .  But there be one little-discussed election rule that have disenfranchise thousand of people in the 7th District , throughout Georgia and in state across the country in 2018 .
When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago, they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground ... (and) those earthquakes stopped.
***** North Texas have long be know for it destructive tornado and fierce thunderstorm , but earthquake ? .  In recent year , though , many have note an uptick in the number of quake in the Lone Star State .  I have notice what seem an increased number of earthquake .  Is fracking a cause ? .  be it from the wastewater disposal procedure associate with fracking or the process itself .
***** Water leave over from oil and natural gas production may strengthen the magnitude of earthquake in state like Oklahoma and Kansas , accord to a new study .  “ It doesn ’ t take a large fault to generate a damaging earthquake , ” say Martin Chapman , a seismologist at Virginia Tech .  And while scientist have long know that wastewater can trigger earthquake , the new study publish in the journal Nature find that the water may be sink deep than previously think , lead to an increase proportion of high magnitude earthquake .  Will the fluid intersect fault ? .
***** Global Fossil Infrastructure Tracker Oil and gas infrastructure Proposed coal mine in China Proposed gas plant Steel plant Fracking be know to cause very slight tremor when the fluid be inject into shale rock under high pressure .  4 Texas Background Quakes report in Ohio , Oklahoma , and Arkansas in 2011 and 2012 be associate with wastewater injection well ( not fracking per se ) .  The water first use in fracture rock be retrieve and pump into the injection well .  At more than 9,000 foot deep , the water be under high pressure that can build up over month or year ; this pressure can cause earthquake .  from 2000-2011 , and those quake have be strongly correlate to wastewater injection from fracking .  3 Regulations Regulations for injection well ( such a well use for dispose fracking wastewater ) be design around protect aquifer , not seismic risk .  The federal Environmental Protection Agency , which regulate oil- and gas-related disposal well unless it cede it authority to the state , have no seismic requirement for it disposal well .  Drilling and disposal company do not usually know where fault in deeper , old rock beneath shale ( the `` basement `` ) exist , a seismic survey be costly , and state do not require them for oil or gas well ( although large company routinely conduct seismic test a part of exploration ) .  4 According to E & E , oil and gas producer be exempt from a federal environmental law design to prevent industrial waste injection well from trigger earthquake , although in 2012 the EPA begin draft suggestion for state regulator to minimize earthquake cause by waste injection .  5 In July 2013 the EPA state that operator should 'not operate ' quake-linked disposal well .  The State Oil and Gas Commission be concern enough about a probable link between disposal well and the earthquake that in July 2011 it order that one well be shut down , and it place a moratorium on new one in an 1,100-square-mile area .  The injection well have be out of use since September 2011 , but though water be no longer be add , linger pressure difference from wastewater injection could still be contribute to the lubrication of long-stuck fault , accord to Frohlich .  The Army discontinue use of the well in February 1966 after a series of earthquake in the area .  Injection have be discontinue at the site in the previous year once the link between the fluid injection and the early series of earthquake be establish .
***** Hydraulic fracturing , or “ fracking , ” ( a drilling process that inject million of gallon of water , sand and chemical under high pressure into a well , crack the rock and to release natural gas and oil ) have only be know to rarely cause earthquake .  But the disposal of drilling wastewater use in fracking have now be scientifically link to earthquake .  The fluid use in fracking ( and the wastewater that come back up the well ) be dispose of by inject it into disposal well deep underground .  But in some part of the country , especially in the Barnett Shale area around Dallas-Fort Worth , it have also be cause earthquake .  How Fracking Disposal Wells Can Cause Earthquakes The culprit of earthquake near fracking site be not believe to be the act of drilling and fracture the shale itself , but rather the disposal well .  Disposal well be the final resting place for use drilling fluid .  These waste well be locate thousand of foot underground , encase in layer of concrete .  They usually store the waste from several different well .  There be more than 50,000 disposal well in Texas service more than 216,000 active drilling well , accord the the Railroad Commission .  Each well use about 4 .
***** 2014-12-01 The seismic gap theory , which identify region of elevate hazard base on a lack of recent seismicity in comparison to other portion of a fault , have successfully explain past earthquake and be useful for qualitatively describe where future large earthquake might occur .  A large earthquake have be expect in the subduction zone adjacent to northern Chile , which until recently have not rupture in a megathrust earthquake since a M~8 .  2 earthquake occur within this northern Chile seismic gap , offshore of the city of Iquique ; the size and spatial extent of the rupture indicate it be not the earthquake that have be anticipate .  Here , we present a rapid assessment of the seismotectonics of the March-April 2014 seismic sequence offshore northern Chile , include analysis of earthquake ( fore- and aftershock ) relocation , moment tensor , finite fault model , moment deficit calculation , and cumulative Coulomb stress transfer calculation over the duration of the sequence .  Our result indicate that while accumulate strain have be release for a portion of the northern Chile seismic gap , significant section have not rupture in almost 150 year .  These observation suggest that large-to-great sized megathrust earthquake will occur north and south of the 2014 Iquique sequence sooner than might be expect have the 2014 event rupture the entire seismic gap .  Repeating earthquake sequence often precede volcanic eruption or lava dome activity , provide an opportunity for short-term eruption forecasting .  However , repeat earthquake sequence may also occur after eruption or along with magma intrusion that do not immediately lead to an eruption .  The temporal evolution of the inverse moment rate be observe to differ for precursory and non-precursory sequence , and multiple earthquake sequence may occur concurrently .  We develop an automated repeat earthquake sequence detector and near real-time alarm to send alert when an in-progress sequence be identify .  The Bogoslof eruption produce almost 40 repeat earthquake sequence between it start in mid-December 2016 and early June 2017 , 21 of which precede an explosive eruption , and 2 sequence in the month before eruptive activity .
***** However , wastewater produce by well that be hydraulic fracture can cause “ induced ” earthquake when it be inject into deep wastewater well .  Wastewater disposal well operate for long duration and inject much more fluid than the hydraulic fracturing operation .  Hence , wastewater injection be much more likely to induce earthquake than hydraulic fracturing .  Most wastewater injection well be not associate with felt earthquake .  A combination of many factor be necessary for injection to induce felt earthquake .  Hydraulic fracture be use in many establish oil and gas produce region of the country as well a some area new to the petroleum industry .  Hydraulic fracturing in vertical well have be use for over fifty year to improve the flow of oil and gas from conventional reservoir .  However , the current practice of horizontal drill couple with multiple application of hydraulic fracturing in a single well be pioneer in the late 1980s and have continue to evolve .
***** Clark ( Stanolind Oil and Gas Corporation ) Year of invention1947 Hydraulic fracturing , also call fracking , hydrofracking , and hydrofracturing , be a well stimulation technique involve the fracturing of bedrock formation by a pressurized liquid .  The process involve the high-pressure injection of `` fracking fluid `` ( primarily water , contain sand or other proppants suspend with the aid of thicken agent ) into a wellbore to create crack in the deep-rock formation through which natural gas , petroleum , and brine will flow more freely .  When the hydraulic pressure be remove from the well , small grain of hydraulic fracturing proppants ( either sand or aluminium oxide ) hold the fracture open .  5 million `` frac job `` have be perform worldwide on oil and gas well , over one million of those within the U .  34 Such treatment be generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rate in shale gas , tight gas , tight oil , and coal seam gas well .  8 Increased oil and gas production from the decade-long fracking boom have lead to low price for consumer , with near-record low of the share of household income go to energy expenditure .  11 Its proponent advocate the economic benefit of more extensively accessible hydrocarbons,1213 as well a replace coal with natural gas , which burn more cleanly and emit less carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .  1415 Opponents of fracking argue that these be outweigh by the environmental impact , which include groundwater and surface water contamination,16 noise and air pollution , and the triggering of earthquake , along with the result hazard to public health and the environment .  24 Increases in seismic activity follow hydraulic fracture along dormant or previously unknown fault be sometimes cause by the deep-injection disposal of hydraulic fracture flowback ( a byproduct of hydraulically fracture well ) ,25 and produce formation brine ( a byproduct of both fracture and nonfractured oil and gas well ) .  3 Oil and gas well 2 .  3 Fracturing fluid 3 .  In earthquake seismology , seismometers scatter on or near the surface of the earth record S-waves and P-waves that be release during an earthquake event .
***** The recent increase in earthquake in the central United States be primarily cause by disposal of waste fluid that be a byproduct of oil production .  Wastewater disposal well typically operate for long duration and inject much more fluid than be inject during the hydraulic fracturing process , make them more likely to induce earthquake .  In Oklahoma , which have the most induced earthquake in the United States , 2 % of earthquake can be link to hydraulic fracturing operation .  Given the high rate of seismicity in Oklahoma , this mean that there be still many earthquake induce by hydraulic fracturing .  The remain earthquake be induce by wastewater disposal .  The large earthquake know to be induce by hydraulic fracturing in the United States be a magnitude 4 .  0 earthquake that occur in 2018 in Texas .
***** Shop NowEnvironmentDrilling for EarthquakesScientists be increasingly confident about the link between earthquake and oil and gas production , yet regulator be slow to reactBy Anna Kuchment on March 28 , 2016Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on RedditShare on LinkedInShare via EmailPrint Credit .  The cause , scientist say , be inject wastewater from oil and gas operation into deep underground well .  The injection can alter stress that hold geologic fault together , let them slip , unleash an earthquake .  Quakes could continue even if injection be stop because pressure change already induce in deep rock can migrate for year , possibly encounter fault .  Experts have not yet tie the quake to oil and gas production , but the epicenter be near wastewater disposal well , structure that have be implicate in early quake in the state .  To Cathy Wallace , the earthquake that have be rattle her tidy suburban home in Dallas feel like underground thunderstorm .  Until 2008 not a single earthquake have ever be record by the U .  Geological Survey from the DallasFort Worth ( DFW ) area , where Wallace have live for more than 20 year .  Statewide , Texas be experience a sixfold increase in earthquake over historical level .  Oklahoma have see a 160-fold spike in quake , some of which have send people to hospital and damage building and highway .  In 2014 the state 's earthquake rate surpass California 's .  By September 2015 , when the commission issue it rule , the volume of wastewater be inject in the vicinity of the earthquake have be reduce , the earthquake have die down and the well operator be officially allow to continue business a usual .  Matt Skinner , a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission , which regulate oil and gas in the state , say the agency have be shut down individual well and take other step to manage earthquake risk since 2013 .
***** Earthquakes beneath DFW International Airport continue for seven year after an oil and gas company shut a nearby wastewater injection well that have be link to the quake , accord to a new study by scientist at Southern Methodist University .  A wastewater well that continue to operate at the northern end of the airport - and which some area resident have say should be close -- be probably not involve in the event and pose little earthquake hazard , the researcher conclude .  “ Faults be not like a light switch - you don ’ t turn off a well and automatically stop trigger earthquake , ” say Heather DeShon , a seismologist at Southern Methodist University and co-author of the paper , in an email .  The earthquake at DFW Airport start on Halloween 2008 , seven week after Chesapeake Energy begin inject wastewater into a well at the southern end of the airport .  Scientists at SMU and the University of Texas at Austin investigate the quake at the time and conclude they be most likely associate with the well .

California earthquake count be show a a blue bar and Oklahoma earthquake count be show a a red bar .  While these earthquake have be induce by oil and gas related process , few of these earthquake be induce by fracking .

When scientist ( specifically , Ralph Keeling ’ s father ) first start measure atmospheric CO2 consistently in 1958 , at the pristine Mauna Loa mountaintop observatory in Hawaii , the CO2 level stand at 316 part per million ( ppm ) , just a little high than the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm .  But a human keep dig up carbon out of the ground and burn it for fuel , CO2 level speed faster and faster toward that target .  In May 2013 , at the time of the usual annual maximum of CO2 , the air briefly tip over the 400 ppm mark for the first time in several million year .

The last time the concentration of Earth 's main greenhouse gas reach this mark , horse and camel live in the high Arctic .  This time , 400 ppm be a milepost on a far more rapid uphill climb toward an uncertain climate future .  The NOAA team be the first to post word on it web site .  The daily average for May 9 be 400 .  Why do he keep at it for 47 year , fight off periodic effort to cut his funding ? .  A year before the historic measurement be record at Mauna Loa , NOAA report that the average of it Arctic measurement have exceed 400 ppm for the entire month of May , not just for a single day .

***** Human activity ( primarily the burning of fossil fuel ) have fundamentally increase the concentration of greenhouse gas in Earths atmosphere , warm the planet .  Natural driver , without human intervention , would push our planet toward a cooling period .  Scientists attribute the global warming trend observe since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the `` greenhouse effect `` 1 warm that result when the atmosphere trap heat radiate from Earth toward space .  Certain gas in the atmosphere block heat from escape .  Long-lived gas that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to change in temperature be describe a `` force `` climate change .  Water vapor increase a the Earths atmosphere warm , but so do the possibility of cloud and precipitation , make these some of the most important feedback mechanism to the greenhouse effect .  Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
***** We have a pretty good idea of what Earth 's atmosphere have look like for the past 800,000 year .  Humans like u — Homo sapiens — only evolve about 200,000 year ago , but ice-core record reveal intricate detail of our planet 's history from long before human exist .  By drill more than 3 kilometer deep into the ice sheet over Greenland and Antarctica , scientist can see how temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide level have change from then until now .  From that record , we know the atmosphere and the air that we breathe have never have a much carbon dioxide in it a it do today .  For the first time in recorded history , the average monthly CO2 level in atmosphere exceed 410 part per million ( ppm ) in the month of April , accord to observation make at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii .  The new record be not a coincidence — human have rapidly transform the air we breathe by pump CO2 into it over the past two century .

***** and New Tax Cuts Won ’ t Change That By Matthew Gardner and Steve Wamhoff The Trump-GOP tax law enact in December 2017 create clear incentive for American-based corporation to move operation and job abroad , include a zero percent tax rate on many profit generate offshore .  Now the Trump administration and some lawmaker who support the 2017 law say they be concern about company move job offshore , particularly to China , and call for additional tax break to lure them back .  New tax cut to incentivize bring job back to the United States will fail .  No new tax provision can be more generous than the zero percent rate the 2017 law provide for many offshore profit or the loophole that allow corporation to shift profit to country with minimal or no corporate income tax .  Problems Created by the 2017 Law Can Only Be Solved by Replacing It with Real Tax Reform An ITEP report publish after lawmaker enact the Trump-GOP tax law explain the several way it encourage American-based corporation to shift profit offshore and even shift real operation and job offshore .  tax on offshore profit only when those profit exceed 10 percent of their offshore tangible asset .  tax by move even more tangible asset , and the job that usually go with them , abroad to ensure that it profit do not exceed 10 percent of it total tangible asset hold offshore .  tax , the rate impose be far low than the rate impose on domestic profit .  Until Congress overhaul these provision , it be difficult to imagine how any new tax cut impose on top of the 2017 law could reverse the incentive it create to shift profit and job offshore .  More importantly , the idea that the United States should lure investment by offer a low corporate tax rate ( rather than improve infrastructure , education of it workforce or any other factor ) imply a global race to the bottom a country try to outdo each other with corporate tax cut .
***** 6 Ways the Trump Administration Is Rigging an Already Unfair Tax Code The Trump administration ’ s tax policy have overwhelmingly favor the wealthy .  ( Getty/Johannes Eisele/AFP ) The New York Times recently report that President Donald Trump pay no income tax for most of the last two decade and only $ 750 in 2016 and 2017—spotlighting how a wealthy and unscrupulous business owner can take advantage of a broken tax code and weak tax enforcement .  Since take office , President Trump ’ s administration have only make the tax code worse .  Here be six way the administration ’ s tax policies—particularly the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA ) —further rig the tax code in favor of corporation and the wealthy and powerful .  The Trump administration ’ s main legislative accomplishment be a hugely regressive tax cut The tax bill that President Trump sign into law in 2017 dramatically cut tax for wealthy individual and corporation .  It slash the top individual income tax rate , carve out a special new deduction mainly benefit wealthy business owner , gutted the tax on large inheritance , and significantly reduce tax on corporation .  Taken together , the change this law make will dramatically reduce tax bill for the very wealthy , leave the working and middle class with little benefit .  In 2020 , the average household in the 1 percent will receive a tax cut of $ 50,000—77 time large than the average cut for the bottom 80 percent of Americans .  The TCJA open up new loophole for the wealthy Although labeled “ tax reform , ” the 2017 tax law actually open up major new loophole for the wealthy to exploit .  Conclusion The Trump administration ’ s tax policy have substantially reduce revenue and funneled tax break to the wealthy household .  Instead of genuine tax reform that would end loophole and game opportunity to ensure that large corporation and the wealthy pay their fair share , the Trump administration ’ s tax policy cut rate and carve out new loophole for the wealthy to exploit .

American sabotage have likely play a role in Pyongyang ’ s string of failed missile launch in recent year .  continue it covert cyberprogram last year , 88 percent of North Korea ’ s flight test of it intermediate-range Musudan missile end in failure .  Given that these missile typically explode , sometimes scatter in piece into the sea , determine the precise cause—particularly for expert outside North Korea—is impossible .  Failure be a big part of missile development , and missile can blow up on their own for plenty of reason , but the percentage of failure certainly suggest sabotage .  The normal failure rate for developmental missile test , accord to The Times , be about 5 to 10 percent .  The Kim regime display a panoply of new missile for the occasion—but the test-firing of a missile the next day fail , perhaps a a result of American sabotage .  When he have nuclear ICBMs , North Korea will have a more potent and lethal strike capability against the United States and it ally , but no chance of destroy America , or win a war , and therefore no good chance of avoid the inevitable consequence of launch a nuke .

SSN mission include gather surveillance data , communicate tactical information , control the surface and undersea battlespace , and deliver strike weapon or special operation force ashore in contingency .  The May 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review ( QDR ) reinforce the ongoing shift in SSN mission from open-ocean antisubmarine warfare and surveillance toward power projection , support of special operation force , and littoral ASW , while make a modest reduction in force size by the end of the FYDP .  This force structure reflect continue deactivation of SSN-637 and old 688-class submarine , delivery of the remain two Seawolf-class ( SSN-21 ) unit through FY 2003 , and subsequent delivery of the New Attack Submarine ( NSSN ) Virginia class start in FY 2004 .  As of 1999 DOD guidance call for a force of 50 attack submarine , although some Navy study suggest that operational requirement demonstrate a need for a force of at least 72 submarine .  The 1999 Joint Staff Attack Submarine Study evaluate exclusive SSN mission require by the warfighting CINCs .  The study be an extraordinarily detail study that employ SSN mission data provide exclusively by the regional CINCs to determine future SSN requirement .  The study result prove consistent with current operational experience , which show a force structure-requirements mismatch .

The controversy over the submarine appear likely to continue past the forthcoming election and into the following year .  Again over recent month , the operational performance of the submarine have draw favourable attention due to the success of HMAS Waller in Exercises RIMPAC and Tandem Thrust .  Indeed , the Collins submarine appear to have outstanding performance in several area , which may well justify Navy 's decision in the mid-1980s to develop a unique design .  However , to be able to operate at the level desire by the RAN , all six submarine will need to complete an enhancement program which , include a new combat system when it be eventually choose , will add $ 1 billion to the $ 5 .

Navy leadership about the need for sustained attack submarine production to confront grow international threat during a morning hearing with Secretary of Defense Ash Cater .  Over the last several week , Courtney have hear from a range of witness about the grow demand on our submarine force , the need to reevaluate the current force structure requirement for attack submarine , and urgency of sustain the current two a year production rate of Virginia Class Submarines .  As Courtney heard from the witness over the last two month , the submarine force be strain to meet demand for it capability at the current force level today , would be severely challenge to do so a the force level dip in the future , and that one of the most impactful action that can be take in the near term be to sustain the build rate on Virginia Class Submarines at two a year for a long a possible .  As Ranking Member of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee , Courtney be utilize this testimony to ensure that the Navy have the resource and authority it need to sustain the two a year attack submarine production rate into the next five year block contract ( 2019-2023 ) , and beyond , to meet the urgent and grow demand for enhanced undersea capability .  Retired Admiral Jim Stavridis tell Courtney that Russian submarine activity be “ probably 70 to 80 percent of what we saw during Cold War time .  “ Admiral Stavridis , in your write statement you mention that Russian submarine activity have rise to a level not see since the Cold War day .

I will discuss the status of the Highway Trust Fund , option for highway spending , and approach to pay for that spending .  Summary Federal spending on highway ( or , synonymously , road ) total $ 47 billion in 2019 .  ( Those government typically spend roughly three time a much of their own fund on highway each year , not only on capital project but also to operate and maintain road .  That $ 47 billion also include spend for federal program that subsidize state and local government ’ borrow for highway project ; other subsidy for state and local borrowing be provide through the tax code .  Most federal spending for highway be pay for by revenue credit to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund , largely from excise tax on gasoline , diesel , and other motor fuel .  For more than a decade , those revenue have fall short of federal spending on highway , prompt transfer from the Treasury ’ s general fund to the trust fund to make up the difference .  The Congressional Budget Office project that balance in both the highway and transit account of the Highway Trust Fund will be exhaust in 2022 .  If the tax that be currently credit to the trust fund remain in place and if funding for highway and transit program increase annually at the rate of inflation , the shortfall accumulate in the Highway Trust Fund ’ s highway and mass transit account from 2022 to 2031 would total $ 195 billion , accord to CBO ’ s baseline budget projection a of February 2021 .  2 The current authorization for federal highway program expire on September 30 , 2021 .
